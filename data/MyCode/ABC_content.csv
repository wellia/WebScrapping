2021-10-28,ABC,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-28/opal-tower-developer-icon-reveals-24-million-spent-on-repairs/11452742,2019-08-27,Opal Tower builder Icon put aside $1 million for building defects but has spent $24 million so far - ABC News,"Construction giant Icon claims it has spent $24 million since the evacuation of its cracked Opal Tower skyscraper, despite putting only $1 million aside as a ""provision for defects"".

Financial statements accessed by the ABC reveal Icon — the company that built the tower — was holding just $1.09 million in the fund for its portfolio of buildings across NSW.

However, it has forked out $24 million and counting since the Opal Tower disaster, which happened just months after the building opened its doors.

Many builders have funds to cover defects, however one expert said the ""very modest amount"" Icon had put aside was indicative of the under-regulated industry and an example of why reform was needed.

All 392 apartments in Opal Tower, at Sydney's Olympic Park, were evacuated on Christmas Eve when cracks were spotted in the building, with residents forced out of their homes and into temporary accommodation.

More than eight months on, 15 owners are still locked out of their apartments as rectification works continue.

Some owners have launched a class action law suit against the State Government.

Icon told the ABC the ""Opal Tower event"" was insurable, however it did not reveal how much of the $24 million — which also includes an amount spent on housing residents in temporary accommodation — it was planning to claim.

It said the bill to repair Opal Tower would not come out of the $1.09 million defects fund, listed in its financial results.

Icon is broken into state-based companies, with the NSW arm reporting $163.4 million in revenue for 2018, well down from the $335.3 million it reported in 2017.

It banked a $1.63 million net profit in 2018, down from $6.8 million in 2017.

Across the company, Icon estimates a ""$1.7 billion"" project pipeline this year.

An Icon spokesperson said the company's approach to Opal Tower since the Christmas Eve evacuation ""cannot be questioned"".

""[This is] all without admission of liability,"" a company spokesperson said.

The Opal Tower situation triggered a domino effect across the NSW industry, with a parliamentary inquiry into the regulation of building standards wrapping up yesterday.

Strata law expert David Bannerman's firm Bannerman Lawyers has represented clients in more than 300 cases.

He said the NSW industry's issues came down to the lack of mandatory home warranty insurance.

Home warranty insurance is taken out by a builder on behalf of the owners and covers the costs of repair of defective or unfinished works when the builder has disappeared, died or become insolvent.

But if a building is more than four storeys high, it is not required.

""It's stupidity, absolute stupidity,"" Mr Bannerman said. 

""If that insurance was in place [it] wouldn't be the debacle it is today."" 

But Mr Bannerman said the ""modest amount"" Icon set aside for defects was a reflection of the way the industry worked.

""Buildings are not going to be faultless, they don't come off a manufacturers plant and there's always going to be something go wrong to come and fix up,"" Mr Bannerman said.

""But usually what happens is the builders just lean back on the subcontractors and say, 'I need you to fix this for me or I'm not going to give you the next job'.

""A big part of that [provision for defects fund] would be for what the subcontractors can't complete.""

At an extraordinary general meeting in Sydney on Thursday night, the owners of units in the beleaguered towers complex voted to raise $7 million in special levies for remediation works to start.

The meeting was also told the repair bill for the remediation works at the 132-unit block could run as high as $20 million, which is about $150,000 for each unit

They had earlier rejected a $10 million special levy loan, which would have incurred more than $3 million in interest, and will begin paying the first instalments in October.

Resident Brian Tucker said it was an exhausting night.

""There's a lot of people that are really financially stressed, people are just so distressed,"" he said.

Engineers, who have been assessing the damage at Mascot Towers and believe they know what caused the building to crack also spoke at the meeting, which ran for more than four hours.

However, they did not make their report public.

Patrick McGuire, from the building's owners corporation, said the engineers had been focusing on the ""construction and development work"" in a nearby area.

""The engineers indicated that the building had to be stabilised ... they had in their view some fairly clear ideas about some root causes as to the building (cracking),"" Mr McGuire.

""The only detail that I'm prepared to say is that it related back to construction work within the general precinct.""

Residents were evacuated in June due to cracking in the primary support structure and have since been living in temporary accommodation.

Last week, NSW building commissioner David Chandler launched an attack on the builders of the troubled towers complex and described the development as one of the most poorly built constructions he had seen.

""I'm quite certain that the builder didn't know how to read any construction plans, because the faults that are in that building are simply someone who didn't pay any attention to them,"" he told a NSW Upper House inquiry.

The ABC understands Bayside Council officers had on Monday accompanied the Building Commissioner for an on-site inspection of the building next door to the towers, at 27 Church Street.

The developers of the adjacent building denied the construction at their site was in any way to blame and that the ""existing damage"" at Mascot Towers was unrelated to them.

Residents have been told there may be a staged return into the building and that some of them maybe able to move back into the apartment block early next year.

The Mascot Towers fiasco came after another apartment building — Opal Tower, at Sydney Olympic Park — had to be evacuated on Christmas Eve last year after cracks were discovered.

""We come to this country thinking of how much of a future we'll have compared to back home, but we end up like this,"" said a Mascot Towers resident who requested anonymity.

""It's not fair. Because of someone else's fault we will have to bear all the consequences.""

667,000 apartments in 18 years. What could go wrong?

For the past two decades, Australia has been in an apartment building boom.

Governments have got out of the way, removing red tape and introducing private certification for an industry that's worth more than $141 billion*. 

But when Sydney's Opal and Mascot Towers were evacuated because of structural cracking, the issue of defective high-rises was laid bare. 

Experts have told Four Corners that the problem stretches across the country and many apartments built in the last 20 years are likely to contain some kind of defect. 

So how bad could the problem be in your state?

There have been 667,394 apartments, flats or units built nationwide from the end of 2000 up until March this year, according to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

A study by Deakin and Griffith universities also surveyed buildings in Australia's east coast states and found more than 70 per cent had at least one defect. All were built after 2003.

The Griffith-Deakin study's co-author, Dr Nicole Johnston, told Four Corners high-rise defects were a problem in every state and territory.

""It's systemic and it's infecting lots of buildings across the landscape, in all parts of the country. It's very clear and it's very prominent, and we've got a serious problem here,"" she said.

""I think it's irresponsible for any government to pretend like this is not happening in their state.""

There have been 259,580 new apartments built in NSW since 2000, according to the ABS figures.

Ninety-seven per cent of buildings in New South Wales surveyed in the Griffith-Deakin study had at least one defect in multiple locations. The study looked at buildings built between 2003 and 2018.

The study found that the most common type of defect was waterproofing, followed by fire safety systems.

There have been 174,896 new apartments built in Victoria since 2000, according to the ABS.

The Griffith-Deakin study looked at buildings built there between 2008 and 2017 and found that 74 per cent had defects.

There have been 143,704 new apartments built in Queensland since 2000.

The Griffith-Deakin study looked at a selection of buildings built between 2008 and 2017 in Queensland and found that 71 per cent had defects.

Dr Johnston said when defects were found, they were generally a chronic problem across a building.

""It's not isolated to one type or one part of the building. It's across multiple areas in relation to how the building is being constructed,"" she said.

There have been 39,680 new apartments built in Western Australia since 2000.

The CEO of the Property Council of Australia, Ken Morrison, is not surprised that so many apartment buildings around the country are likely to have defects.

""When you're doing something very complicated like building a high-rise apartment building, there are going to be things which need to get fixed up,"" he said.

There have been 14,418 new apartments built in South Australia since 2000.

In Tasmania there have been 1,849.

And in the ACT there have been 26,116.

In the Northern Territory there have been 7,150 new apartments built since 2000.

A structural engineer, John Scott, is facing a building inquiry after nine buildings in Darwin and Palmerston were found to not comply with national construction standards.

Right now, there are plans to build close to 140,000 more apartments around the country.

There is no guarantee these new developments will be built under the stricter regulations recommended in a report by lawyer Bronwyn Weir and former senior public servant Peter Shergold, commissioned by Australian state and federal building ministers.

The report's 24 recommendations included a crackdown on private certification, and registration of everyone involved in the building process.

At a meeting in July, building ministers committed to implementing the reforms.

Ms Weir warns the recommendations will do nothing to fix potential problems in the 667,394 apartments built in the last two decades.

""There's a lot of existing building stock that has defects in it,"" she said.

""There'll be legacy issues for some time, and I suspect there'll be legacy issues that we're not even fully aware of yet.""

Watch Sean Nicholls' investigation into the building sector, Cracking Up, on Monday on Four Corners at 8.30pm on ABC TV and iview.

It is one of the latest cases to emerge on a growing list of faulty apartments as national and state authorities grapple with how to manage the issue.

Louisa Carter purchased a new four-bedroom sub-penthouse in The Johnson apartment tower in inner-city Brisbane in 2017.

The former Department of Transport building in Spring Hill was transformed into an art series hotel and residential complex by developer and Melbourne-based Asian Pacific Group, now known as the Deague Group.

But Dr Carter said her roof began leaking just days after she and her family moved into the apartment.

""In the first big storm, suddenly there was water pouring into the main bedroom,"" she said.

Her apartment was later overtaken by mould.

Despite lodging a series of complaints, more than two years later the defects are yet to be fully rectified.

She said her apartment was still awaiting a refit after being partially gutted because of the water damage.

""This is a state-heritage listed property — it's meant to be kept for future generations,"" she said.

""We've got a colander for a roof pouring [water] down through the concrete.""

Dr Carter said she first raised issues with the developer and her body corporate, and also complained to Queensland's Building and Construction Commission (QBCC).

The QBCC ordered construction company Maxcon to fix the leak and later closed the case file after some works were carried out.

But the body corporate's insurance company recently found there were still building defect issues with the property, and while it was willing to pay thousands of dollars to refurbish the unit, it would not authorise work until the issues were resolved.

After complaining to the Office of Fair Trading that her unit was not fit for purpose, Dr Carter was told the matter was classified as a ""warranty"" issue, suggesting she could take civil action in court.

She said she had been left thousands of dollars out of pocket after renting another property.

""We're in limbo,"" she said.

""We're caught in a stalemate between parties — I feel like collateral damage in a financial equation and it's just not good enough — it's my home.""

Dr Carter is now set to pursue Maxcon Construction for compensation via a referral from the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal (QCAT) to the Supreme Court.

She is also raising the matter with Queensland Housing Minister Mick de Brenni.

Water damage has been reported in at least one other apartment on the same level.

Last week, state and territory ministers held emergency talks in response to a wave of similar problems across the country, including defective buildings and flammable cladding.

Dr Carter said developers should not be allowed voting rights on the body corporate in the first year to give new owners greater power.

""That's just ludicrous — that's the year you're finding out what's wrong with the building,"" she said.

""My issue is, as an individual unit owner, I don't have any control over the common lot — the roof — so I'm caught."" 

When approached by ABC News, a lawyer acting for Maxcon Constructions said the company ""complied with all of its legal obligations in this matter, including rectifying the water leak"" and suggested third parties might have caused or contributed to the problem.

A lawyer for the Deague Group said it was ""not appropriate to comment"" because of the proceedings lodged with QCAT, but denied Dr Carter's claims and said Deague stood by its products and accepted its responsibilities.

Mr de Brenni declined to comment.

A spokesman for the QBCC said a ""guttering issue"" was rectified by the builder, but any further concerns would need to be lodged by the body corporate.

""The QBCC understands that Dr Carter has further concerns about the roof of this building,"" the spokesman said.

""Due to the ownership structure of the building, and because the roof is considered common property, the QBCC would need to receive a complaint from the body corporate in order for the commission to legally carry out an inspection and investigation into the roof of the building.

""At this stage the QBCC has not received a complaint from the body corporate but will continue to provide advice to Dr Carter on the options available to her.""

Editor's note: The ABC understands that, since the time of publication of this article, the proceedings commenced by Dr Carter against Maxcon in QCAT have been dismissed.

The ABC also understands that Dr Carter has brought separate proceedings in QCAT, seeking a review of the QBCC’s direction to rectify.

A report by the University of New South Wales has identified building defects in about 85 per cent of apartment buildings built since 2000.

Common defects include shifting foundations, water leaks, wall cracks and tiling faults.

Under the Government's proposed system, developers of new buildings taller than three storeys will have to pay a bond to cover the remedy of any defects. 

Fair Trading Minister Victor Dominello said ""there is no protection currently in place to ensure that those defects are remedied, other than taking it to court"".

""A defect bond will provide a 2 per cent security to enable most of those defects to be cured,"" he said.

Mr Dominello said it was all part of the Government's plans to bring more clarity to the industry.

""This is the biggest reform to strata since... 1961,"" he said.

""There's a lot of significant reforms coming through and the defect bonds is a part of it.""

Independent assessors will be appointed to investigate possible defects.

The peak body representing developers, the Urban Taskforce, has welcomed the move.

Urban Taskforce's CEO Chris Johnson said most developers already set aside money for any future repairs.

""It formalises the industry approach to having a retention sum, but it does give a lot more rigour about how this is handled,"" he said.

""We need, obviously, to give confidence to all those moving into apartments that any defects will be fixed up, and the defects bond covers the cost of that.

""If there are no defects, the bond obviously goes back to the developer... if there are defects, there's funds to fix up the defects themselves.""

A bill will be introduced to Parliament in October, with the laws likely to come into effect in the new year.

The Azzure holiday apartments overlooking Boat Harbour Beach were finished in 2006 but most have not been lived in since 2012, when the Waratah-Wynyard Council uncovered safety risks relating to fire containment between the units.

Gary Williams and Janice Salisbury were the first to buy a unit in 2007 as part of their retirement plan.

""We had our business, which we sold, and we couldn't wait to come in, so in 2012 we moved in,"" Ms Salisbury said.

Less than a year later, Ms Salisbury had a visit from a council worker while she was cooking dinner.

""There was a knock at the door and a young girl gave us a letter,"" she said.

""We opened it and here was an immediate evacuation order. We had to be out that night.""

An inspection had found fire containment measures between the units were inadequate or non-existent, posing a safety risk to the residents.

Mr Williams said other problems had also emerged.

""The roofing situation was so bad the wind would blow and lift the manhole up, and it was freezing cold, you couldn't warm the building up with the air-conditioning going all the time,"" he said.

""The balconies have got no fall-off for the water to run the right way; it runs inside and floods the carpets, and all the balconies were built incorrectly.""

The builder who carried out the work sold his business in 2008, and last year he died.

The owners were covered by his warranty insurance but they could not make a claim because the builder did not die, disappear or go bankrupt within six years of finishing the job.

Michael Kerschbaum from the Master Builders Association said that the builder was fully licensed and accredited, and told the developer that he would carry out the necessary repairs.

""I believe there were offers made by the builder which weren't up to scratch from the client's point of view and therefore they decided to embark upon a legal claim,"" he said.

""If people do have a problem with a particular builder or a structure that's been built, they need to go back and negotiate in good faith, and I don't think that's the part of the equation that's happened in this instance.""

Developer Gerd Hagmaier said no such offer was made.

Mr Hagmaier owns eight of the 13 units and estimates he has lost $5 million because of the stalled development.

""Builders and architects and engineers, they all enjoy an insurance policy which gives the wrong impression to anyone who builds a house, either owner or the investor, that if something goes wrong the insurance will jump in,"" he said.

Mr Hagmaier is negotiating a settlement with the other parties involved in the development but said that he could not comment on the details.

He has been told by another builder that it would be cheaper to demolish some of the units than to fix their structural problems but a final decision has not been made.

""As a member of a body corporate you can't just decide, 'I'll knock down this building'. I can't leave [the other owners] with a portion of air,"" he said.

Mr Williams and Ms Salisbury say they are $1.5 million out of pocket and hoping they will not have to watch their life savings being demolished.

""We're just astonished to think, you know, you're not covered,"" Ms Salisbury said.

""I'll be 67 in February, Gary will be 65 in a few weeks' time, and we just can't afford to retire because we've got our bills to pay, of course, and still the mortgage.""

In a statement, a spokesman for the Tasmanian Department of Justice said that new laws being introduced later this year and next year will clarify the responsibilities of builders and strengthen compliance.

""The new legislation will reduce the number of disputes that end up in long and costly court proceedings,"" the spokesman said.

""It is expected that the types of non-compliance issues affecting the apartments at Boat Harbour will be more thoroughly addressed as part of those reforms.""

Warranty insurance has been optional for Tasmanian builders since 2008 to reduce the costs associated with building and renovating.

Mr Kerschbaum said that every other state and territory still had some form of mandatory cover.

""We did state to the Government at the time that there were risks with that strategy and that they were effectively leaving consumers in Tasmania with less protection than they have in other jurisdictions,"" he said.

But the association is not lobbying for mandatory indemnity insurance to be reinstated.

""A lot of states in more recent years have had problems with their warranty insurance and they've had to have some sort of government backing to make it operational,"" Mr Kerschbaum said.

The department spokesman said the scheme was widely criticised by homeowners and builders because of its limited coverage and high cost.

It follows on from the emergency evacuation of the 3,000 residents of Opal Towers late last year after beams collapsed.

But the safety of new apartment buildings is not just an issue confined to Sydney.

7.30 has spoken to owners around Australia who are worried they are living in structurally unsound buildings, with little choice but to pay for the defects themselves.

John Grant purchased an off-the-plan investment property in Canberra for $640,000 in 2011. But soon afterwards cracks began to spread throughout the apartment car park.

Concerns about the structural integrity of the building meant the foundations had to be reinforced with 45 props.

Mr Grant said they had been advised the defects could be fixed, but the repair bill was estimated at a staggering $9 million. If the owners end up having to pay for the rectification themselves it could cost each apartment owner an average of $75,000.

""There's no-one who protects future apartment owners during the construction,"" he told 7.30.

The owners have already had to spend $650,000 on expert reports and legal fees. They are suing the builder, developer and the engineer, and Mr Grant is calling for the ACT Government to issue a rectification order to force the builders to pay for the defects.

""When there is a problem, those responsible deny it, and they deny it vociferously, and it means that you have to go through lengthy and expensive processes to actually get a result,"" Mr Grant said.

""Even then nothing's guaranteed, and that's a real concern with all of us owners.""

Nicole Johnston from Deakin University has just released a report into building safety. She says that would-be owners often have no way of knowing if there are structural problems with their apartments.

""Sometimes it doesn't matter how much due diligence you do, you won't know that these defects are coming,"" she said.

Her report found poor waterproofing, unsafe cladding and fire risks were the most common problems.

""The costs involved in going through those rectification works is so much more than it would have been if the job was done right in the first place,"" Dr Johnston said.

""So the costs in relation to rectify the fix is exorbitant, and it's grossly unfair for the people having to pay.""

Federal Industry Minister Karen Andrews told 7.30 in a statement that states and territory governments were responsible for implementing building codes.

""I believe there is a crisis of confidence in the building sector that needs to be addressed,"" she said.

The Property Council of Australia's chief executive, Ken Morrison, argued that Australia had some of the best building standards in the world.

""Purchasers should take heart from the fact that most issues are relatively minor,"" he said.

""The sorts of incidents we've seen in the media in recent months are quite rare.""

He said while regulations in the various states and territories differ, there was recourse when owners found their apartment had faults. 

""If there are defects, then by law builders have to come back and fix those defects at their costs, and that system has been working well,"" he said.

Melbourne apartment owner Andy White said the system had not been working for him.

Following a fire in one of the apartments in his complex, it was discovered the building was covered in flammable cladding. But the builders went into voluntary liquidation in August 2018, meaning the owners will now have to cover the estimated $2-3 million rectification costs.

He said the apartment he bought for $320,000 was worth much less today.

""It's a huge financial strain for most people, it's taking a lot of toll on people's mental health, to say the least,"" he said.

""A lot of people are feeling frustrated and hopeless that they're now stuck with a property that is virtually worthless at this point of time.""

He said it was too easy for builders to liquidate their companies if they found themselves liable for building defects.

""I just really want the Government to step up and sort out the legislation so that the people responsible for this situation are made to rectify it,"" he said.

""By law at the moment we have more consumer protection buying a toaster or a television than we do an apartment.""

A spokesperson for Victorian Planning Minister Richard Wynne said the Victorian Building Authority was working closely with the affected residents.

""Our dedicated cladding taskforce is expected to finalise their final report in the coming weeks and will have more to say when we have assessed its recommendations,"" the spokesperson said.

The faults in the $2-billion hospital included 33 rooms built the wrong size and a loading dock 70 centimetres short in height.

The Supreme Court action centred on the jurisdiction of a so-called independent expert, who oversaw the dispute over defects.

The Government argued the building consortium, SA Health Partnership, ""enlarged"" the expert's powers to adjudicate.

In a complicated judgement, Justice Malcolm Blue has agreed with the Government that the expert did not have the jurisdiction to make certain decisions.

They included a determination the Government did not intend to fix the loading dock.

Justice Malcolm Blue has ruled the expert's decision null and void. 

He has also ruled the expert's determination that the wrong-sized rooms were not a defect is null and void.

The builder contended an ""informal"" agreement had been struck with the Government to permit smaller rooms.

The judge also ruled while defects such as the loading dock height are not capable of remedy, damages can still be sought.

Legal costs will be decided in the New Year.

The Government has welcomed the judgement, labelling it a ""very encouraging step forward"". 

""Today's ruling confirms what we've always said, and that is that the contract protects South Australian taxpayers,"" a spokesman for Health Minister Jack Snelling said.

""We're looking forward to moving into the new RAH.""

But a more crucial legal dispute with SA Health Partnership, which will be key to the hospital's opening date, is ongoing.

The Government has said patients could be at risk because there is no back-up for a water cooling system essential to the site's air-conditioning.

As the builder missed the April completion date, it has had to put forward a plan to outline how and when the facility will now be finished.

The Government has rejected that and has warned it is prepared appoint its own builder to finish the hospital.

If that happens the building consortium would likely fall into receivership.

The hospital is almost a year behind schedule, but SA Health Partnership said it is confident it can open to patients in June.

The Government has yet to start repayments of $1 million a day because of the delays.

The builder's financiers, which are waiting repayment, have been drawn into the dispute.

""We had a number of issues that we had trouble getting completed, but the two main ones were that our external timber cladding was installed incorrectly,"" Mr Henty said.

""It was not to code and not to manufacturer's instructions.""

The second issue was in Mr Henty's bathrooms, where he has had to spend an extra $100,000 on repairs.

""The way they installed the grating was faulty, so the joists and the bearers were water damaged and eventually would have collapsed,"" he said.

Mr Henty said he had tried to engage with the building company, Elysium Builders in Tasmania, to fix the problems.

This resulted in the cladding being replaced, but Mr Henty says it made the problem worse.

So he approached the Master Builders Association for help, lodged a complaint with Tasmania's Justice Department, went through third-party mediation, and obtained independent reports on the problems, at his own expense.

He said after going around in circles, the builder eventually stopped responding to emails and calls. 

Mr Henty was advised he had no recourse other than to take the builder to court.

""It has a real toll on the stress in your house, it's really emotional when you've invested in building particularly your own house. You live and breathe these problems everyday.""

""Decisions to suspend or cancel licences are only made in the most serious of cases where sufficient risk to life, property and the interests of the community exists,"" the spokesman said.

Mr Henty said the regulator did not have enough power.

""There is no body in my mind who can help us direct the builder if they're at fault to either fix or compensate. There's just no way you can do that without taking them to court,"" he said.

The Justice Department would not comment on questions regarding Elysium Builders.

But in a letter to a separate Elysium Builders client who complained to CBOS, Justice Department secretary Ginna Webster wrote:

""Ultimately, neither the director, nor the administrator, are empowered to make orders for provisions of remedies for financial loss or compensation, and the apportionment of blame and liability in the determination of contractual disputes is a function of the courts.""

Elysium Builders was contacted for comment.

Another consumer who has complained to CBOS about Elysium Builders, Ash Dunn, said that for many people, court action was expensive and consumers would be further out of pocket.

""You have to weigh up whether spending $100,000 in court to get a $40,000 floor fixed is actually worth it,"" Mr Dunn said.

""You don't need to be Einstein to work out that's not a cost-effective option."" 

He said Elysium Builders used the incorrect seal on his polished concrete floors and hearth, which blistered and peeled as soon as Mr Dunn lit his first fire.

The hearth was repaired, but Mr Dunn said Elysium Builders was yet to fix the floors, which have turned from grey to brown.

""They came back and said there's a problem with the product and that they would fix it … but four and half years later it's still not fixed,"" he said.

""All the power lies with the builder there is no help or support whatsoever for someone who is building a home.""

At the time of Mr Dunn and Mr Henty's builds, Elysium Builders was registered with the Master Builders Association. That membership was later revoked because of a breach of the MBA's code of conduct.

Elysium Builders was a member of the Housing Industry Association from 2016 until February this year.

The HIA's Stuart Collins said the association only received one complaint about the builder, but it was received after Elysium Builders' membership lapsed.

""Where there are complaints we try to address it through some form of conciliatory process, but ultimately [if] we don't license those builders we can't order them to go back and fix things,"" Mr Collins said.

At a time of unprecedented demand for builders, there are fears some will try to get away with cutting corners.

One of the largest builders in Launceston, Steven Simeoni from Tas City Build, said cutting corners was almost guaranteed with all the work around.

""There's a lot of [builders] going out on their own making the most of these times and if they're not controlled something is going to happen,"" Mr Simeoni said.

He said he was regularly called on to fix poor workmanship.

""These builders that are doing the wrong thing and continue doing the wrong thing, they need to be stamped out,"" he said.

Other states have mandated home warranty insurance, which acts as a safety net for consumers.

The MBA's Tasmanian executive director Matthew Pollock is calling for a review into whether it should be reinstated.

""Currently, Tasmania is the only jurisdiction to not have some form of mandated scheme,"" Mr Pollock said.

But the HIA's Stuart Collins said there was a misconception about what warranty insurance covered.

""Warranty insurance is an insurance of last resort, so we're looking at death, disappearance, insolvency, bankruptcy. It has some limitations, so it's not going to cover what we call minor defects,"" he said.

In a statement, a Justice Department spokesman said mandatory home warranty insurance was abolished in Tasmania in 2008, due to high costs and limited coverage.

The spokesman said the insurance was only applicable in cases where a builder died, became insolvent or became otherwise uncontactable and unable to be located.

""The Tasmanian government has confidence in the provisions of the Residential Building Work Contracts and Dispute Resolution Act 2016 to resolve building disputes,"" he said.

2021-10-28,ABC,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-11-18/canberra-traffic-police-building-defects-comcare-notice/12892796,2020-11-17,Work safety watchdog orders AFP to fix Canberra police traffic operations centre - ABC News,"ACT Policing failed to fix health and safety hazards at its Belconnen traffic operations centre for more than two years after the danger was identified.

The federal work safety watchdog confirmed it issued an improvement notice to the Federal Police last week because the building breached work health and safety laws.

Comcare has given ACT Policing until January 29, 2021 to fix the defects, or face fines of up to $250,000.

ACT Policing committed to fix the issues before the deadline, and said work was underway to relocate the traffic operations to a new site.

But the Australian Federal Police Association (AFPA) said the situation had been managed poorly, warning many other buildings occupied by ACT Policing were also defective and in need of repair.

""City Police Station leaks when it rains and is a dated building. The Winchester Police Centre is in a similar state, and everyone knows about the lack of a fit-for-purpose police station in Gungahlin,"" AFPA president Alex Caruana said.

""Everything is a band-aid fix when it comes to ACT Policing accommodation.""

A report on the traffic operations centre's condition in mid-2018 identified 26 defects — with 22 of the defects rated as priority one issues requiring immediate action.

The defects included workplace accessibility, fire, lighting and other general building non-compliance.

The improvement notice said only one of the priority issues had been fixed in the more than two years since hazards were reported.

""At the time of writing this notice, the AFP has 21 priority one defects that still require action, with several not having interim controls identified,"" the Comcare improvement notice said.

""Several of the identified issues had likely existed for some time prior to the completion of the … review, and it was reasonable to expect the AFP to have identified and rectified many of these issues prior to 2018 as part of a routine facility management program.""

Comcare inspectors visited the traffic operations centre in September to collect information on building maintenance and incident and hazard reporting.

The inspectors reported that AFP staff at the centre were ""visibly frustrated with the existing system"".

""Following a review of the available information and based on observations made during the inspection, I formed a reasonable belief that the AFP has not appropriately managed known risks to health and safety,"" the notice reads.

""The current AFP facility management system does not appear to have enabled the AFP to effectively monitor facilities.""

The notice directed ACT Policing to complete six measures to fix the safety contraventions, including reviewing the existing facility management system and the installation of fire exit signage.

Comcare also recommended police ensure other ACT Policing buildings were compliant with safety laws.

ACT Policing said the notice would not affect its officers' ability to police the territory and protect the Canberra community.

""The Justice and Community Safety Directorate and ACT Policing will endeavour to complete the works within the specified timeframe,"" a police spokesperson said.

""Planning and procurement is already underway, or in some instances completed, with funding of $9.6 million allocated to repair work health and safety and building compliance issues across ACT Policing.

""[The] ACT Government has also provided funding to ACT Policing to develop a 20-year Master Accommodation Plan which will ensure stations and facilities are fit-for-purpose. It will be delivered this financial year.""

An alternate site to house Traffic Operations has already been identified and a feasibility study is underway.

But the AFPA said more needed to be done to give officers better workplace accommodation.

The union had previously warned a number of buildings — including the traffic operations centre — were in a state of disrepair, criticising the ACT Government for forcing police to make do with old buildings that were no longer fit for purpose.

""Through all our discussions with ACT Policing and the ACT Government, all the AFPA has heard about is the Police Services Model and Master Accommodation Plan,"" Mr Caruana said.

""This excuse is getting tiresome, considering former chief police officer Justine Saunders initiated these models in 2017 and we've seen very little delivered.

""Why does it take three years to deliver … especially when ACT Policing has been provided funding?""

2021-10-28,ABC,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-01-17/opal-tower-gladys-berejiklian-nsw-government-construction/10720776,2019-01-16,What lies beneath the cracks in Opal Tower — and buildings across Australia - ABC News,"The saga of Opal Tower, the 36-storey Sydney apartment building evacuated on Christmas Eve after frightening cracking, has helped to expose the deep cracks in Australia's approach to building apartments.

An interim engineering assessment released yesterday indicates concrete panels cracked due to their manufacture and assembly deviating from the original design. Though the building is structurally sound and in no danger of collapse, repairing the faults will be costly, slow and disruptive to residents.

The tower's size, age (it is less than six months old) and the timing of its cracks might have made it particularly newsworthy, but badly built apartment blocks are far from unusual. Right now across Australia's cities many buildings have significant leaks, cracks and fire safety failings.

So we can't just address faults in individual developments. We need to identify the systemic flaws in how ""compact city"" policies have been planned and implemented.

The consequences of these flaws increasingly affect us all.

As the population of Australia's capital cities grows, more of us are living in apartments. Governments have been promoting greater housing density as an alternative to sprawl for decades. But they haven't always ensured this density has been done well, including in terms of building quality.

In the aftermath of the Opal Tower saga, experts have pointed to many reasons why building defects can occur.

These include the fact that developers owe buyers few legal obligations once the apartments are sold, which limits their risk if they get things wrong. There are also significant market pressures, particularly in boom times, to build quickly and cheaply. And there are gaps in how the construction process is overseen, meaning errors go unnoticed.

These are not new observations, but getting regulations in place to address them has proven challenging. A case in point is NSW's new defects bond, requiring developers to put aside 2 per cent of the building value to fix defects down the track. The bond's introduction was delayed for years, and it will be a few more years yet before we know if it works.

So just how severe is the situation? Right now, we don't know for sure.

In 2012 a City Futures Research Centre project surveyed apartment owners in NSW. Out of more than 1,000 respondents, 72 per cent knew of defects in their strata-title complex. Among those whose apartments had been built since 2000, the percentage was 85 per cent.

That project only looked at building defects as one of a number of issues facing apartment owners, however, so it didn't document the issue in detail.

Our new research project will examine just how prevalent building defects are, the reasons they occur, and how strata-titled housing can be improved.

While the research will focus on Sydney, we hope it is a step towards changing planning and development policies to ensure better quality apartment buildings nation-wide.

A system allowing defective apartment buildings not only creates huge financial and emotional stress for residents but much wider economic and social risks.

Poor building practices undermine confidence in the multi-billion-dollar construction industry, the strata management industry and in the planning system.

They also contribute to inequality. This is because apartment residents are more likely to be younger, renting, on lower incomes, and from non-English speaking backgrounds.

Amid growing concerns about the widening gap between housing ""haves"" and ""have nots"", there is renewed political interest in housing policy. Certainly this is a crucial issue for governments to tackle, but it goes beyond a focus on housing supply and prices. Addressing quality must also be a priority.

At the same time, we also need to step back and reconsider how we do compact-city planning more broadly — including the roles governments and the private market play. With two-thirds of us now calling our biggest cities home, we need to have a serious public conversation about what we want our cities to be and how we can best achieve those goals.

We can't afford to ignore the growing evidence that our cities are cracking under the strain. Because like the Opal Tower owners, we're all going to bear the cost when things go wrong, and we'll all have to live amid the wreckage.

2021-10-28,ABC,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-30/photographs-show-alleged-defects-at-new-rah/8080412,2016-11-30,Royal Adelaide Hospital alleged defects captured in photographs presented to Supreme Court - ABC News,"Photographs tendered to the Supreme Court have provided the first glimpse of alleged building defects at the centre of a bitter legal row over the new Royal Adelaide Hospital.

The South Australian Government has launched legal action against the hospital's builders in a bid to force them to address issues with the new building.

The Supreme Court heard 33 so-called floor distribution rooms are the wrong size and according to the state would cost $360 million to rectify.

The Government has costed another problem with the hospital's ceiling space at $201 million.

The dispute is holding up the technical completion of the hospital, which is already almost a year behind schedule.

Lawyer Mark Hoffman QC for the hospital's builder, HYLC, said the Government had put forward extreme propositions about how defects might be fixed, with compensation appearing the real motive.

""The state's all over the place. On the one hand it speaks in language of damages, but requires physical rectification,"" he said.

""Quite extraordinary dollar sums are being bandied around or are these defects capable of being remedied?""

He told the court a compromise had been reached during the design evolution process that the rooms would be smaller to allow more clinical space.

""For some reason that formality was not attended to,"" he said.

The photos also show black water pipes in a data equipment room the Government fears may leak, and a loading dock that was built to a height of 2.8 metres instead of 3.5 metres.

Mr Hoffman said Spotless, which will provide hospital services such as cleaning and catering, did not have an issue with the loading dock's reduced height.

He said the Government did not either, but then changed its mind and wanted the problem fixed at a cost of $3.21 million.

""So there was a bet each way,"" he said.

The court heard fixing the dock would involve digging up the floor and putting services underground, a task Mr Hoffman said sounded ""like a large ask"".

The builder had adopted its own remedies for potential leaks in the data room, by putting drip trays under the pipes and installing moisture sensors.

Key to the court case is the jurisdiction of the so-called independent expert, who oversaw the dispute over defects.

The Government argued the builder ""enlarged"" the expert's powers to adjudicate.

But Justice Malcolm Blue questioned whether the Government had gone outside the rules by flagging damages.

""Where it's gone off the rails is where the state starts talking about compensation,"" he said.

Government lawyer Dick Whitington QC responded that it was dragged into the defect dispute by the builder.

""We didn't flick the switch,"" he said.

""Every submission put in for compensation was put in by demands of ProjectCo and the builder,"" he said.

The trial continues.

The alleged faults in the $2 billion hospital include incorrect room sizes, air-conditioning woes, sewer pipes in a data equipment room, a 200-millimetre ceiling space and the height of a loading dock.

Justice Malcolm Blue will visit the site as part of a civil trial between the State Government and project consortium South Australian Health Partnership and an independent expert.

Justice Blue told the court he was happy for the media to film the visit but lawyers for one company in the consortium, builder HYLC, opposed access.

The new hospital is almost a year behind schedule and it is still not clear when it will open, as it remains stuck in a legal quagmire.

Key to the case is the jurisdiction of the so-called independent expert Steven Goldstein, who adjudicated on the alleged defects.

Government lawyer Dick Whitington QC told the court the builder ""enlarged"" the expert's powers to rule on disputes.

He said alleged faults identified by the Government were dismissed by the expert, who urged the flaws be accepted.

""Near enough is good enough, take it as it is,"" Mr Whitington said sarcastically.

Mr Whitingon told the court the height of the hospital's loading dock was meant to be 3.5 metres but it had only been built to 2.8 metres.

The Government was also concerned about potential leaks from sewer pipes that were laid horizontally and vertically in the primary data equipment room.

""There was not meant to be any risk of water ingress,"" Mr Whitington said.

The Government also suggested the builder fix air-conditioning problems by installing six units at a cost of $4.1 million dollars, but that has not happened.

The defence will be presented in coming days.

Opposition health spokesperson Stephen Wade said the defects detailed in the court case were relatively discreet.

""They're certainly not the catastrophic redundancy issues that the [Health] Minister [Jack Snelling] has been hinting at but dares not tell us,"" he said.

""Clearly the Minister has more issues on his mind, which he's not being full and frank with the people of South Australia.

""I'm very keen that the Government gives us a clear statement what the patient safety issues are.""

2021-10-28,ABC,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-03-14/act-licensing-for-builders-lax-mba/5320326,2014-03-13,"ACT licensing for builders lax, mandatory inspections inadequate: Master Builders Association - ABC News","Canberra's building industry says licensing in the ACT is lax and more mandatory inspections during construction are needed to clamp down on building defects. 

Building defects are a widespread problem in units and apartments across Canberra, and those in the industry say standards are continuing to deteriorate. 

Last week the ABC reported on how little has changed in the three years since the ACT Government promised to crack down on substandard building quality.

Jerry Howard from the Master Builders Association (MBA) says many issues relating to building defects can be attributed to the skills of builders. 

He says where once a trade qualification was a prerequisite to becoming a builder, now it can take just six months to obtain a licence, and not much more effort to set up a building company. 

""It's probably easier to get a corporate builders licence than it is to start up a coffee shop in Civic,"" he said.

David Howarth has been building in Canberra for more than 30 years. He agrees that standards have slipped.       

""A lot of people are becoming licensed way too easily,"" he said. 

Adding to that is a lack of skills in supervision. 

A construction company needs only one person to hold a builders license. If that company has multiple projects that one set of skills can be spread very thinly. 

""It is very common that the builder isn't on site all the time, and often this is delegated to people without builders' licences,""said Dean Hall from the construction union, CFMEU. 

The MBA says without proper supervision and experience mistakes can happen, resulting in defects.

Mr Howarth says ongoing training is key to his business.

""You need a proper training regime throughout your organisation so that people know what they are doing, because the techniques of building are changing all of the time,"" he said. 

But he says the issue of quality runs deeper than what happens on a construction site. 

""A lot of the problem we have is a lack of detail supplied to builders by engineers and architects,"" he said.

The industry says many defects could be avoided if there were more mandatory inspections by certifiers. 

Many home buyers believe that if a building has been certified it is free of defects, but in reality the certifier's role is limited.

""To give you an example, there is no requirement to have waterproofing checked in a basement set up in a unit,"" said Mr Howarth.

""The certifiers aren't mandated to do enough inspections in order to certify that the building is correct.""

That is a sentiment echoed by the MBA. 

But ACT Planning Minister Simon Corbell rejects the criticism.

""Certifiers have every capability to be on site whenever they choose to ensure that work is being done according to standard,"" he said. 

The Environment and Sustainable Development Directorate says while it is at the discretion of the certifier to work out how they are satisfied that works are compliant with the Building Act, it would be difficult to do so by only doing the minimum mandatory inspections. 

But others argue that in a private market a certifier will only inspect what they are legally required to, or what they are paid to do. 

While concern increases about current standards and skills slipping, alarm bells are ringing about the future, with apprentice numbers in decline.

Recent data from the National Centre for Vocational Education Research shows that new apprentice commencements fell from 27,500, to 26, 400 in the December quarter of 2013.

Mr Howard says it has become more expensive for employers to take on apprentices.

""Apprentice wages have now been increased by 30 per cent, so there's a disincentive for employers to take on apprentices as well, and this is effective from January this year,"" he said.

However despite the wage increase, Mr Hall says there is little incentive for an apprentice to stay on.

He says many apprentices are being poached by businesses to work as contractors.

""There is a need to see why people aren't following through and completing their trades,"" he said.

""One of the major reasons is the poor amount of money that trainees and apprentices get.

""The reality is a young person can get more money flipping burgers at a takeaway restaurant or working in a large supermarket stacking shelves.""

But both agree that more value needs to be placed on the benefits of having a trade qualification, to ensure the future of the industry.

Courtney Houssos — who is Labor's shadow minister for better regulation — used parliamentary privilege to take aim at agents selling units in the Atmosphere Towers in Castle Hill and the Aya Eliza building in Auburn.

Ms Houssos described the buildings as ""notorious"" and claimed she had discovered several real estate agents had not disclosed to prospective buyers that both developments were under prohibition orders.

A prohibition order prevents an occupation certificate being issued until the developer rectifies listed ""defects"".

It means owners are stranded and unable to move into their brand-new apartment until the order is lifted.

The apartment towers were built by subsidiary companies of two large Sydney developers.

Merhis Group was behind Aya Eliza, while Toplace constructed Atmosphere Towers.

Since December, nine prohibition orders have been issued by NSW Fair Trading in an industry-wide crackdown.

However, in two buildings — Atmosphere and Aya Eliza — the owners had moved in before the order was issued as the developer had secured an interim occupation certificate.

Atmosphere's 20-storey and 21-storey towers were slapped with a prohibition order in June after government inspectors found non-compliant cladding.

They also found the buildings had not been properly waterproofed.

At Aya Eliza, inspectors noted waterproofing issues on the balcony, tiles that were not properly fixed to the walls in bathrooms, and tiled floors with inadequate falls to allow for proper drainage.

In both orders, the Secretary of NSW Fair Trading said a ""serious defect in the building exists"".

The NSW Building Commissioner, David Chandler, said both Atmosphere and Aya Eliza had been deemed safe to live in while rectification works took place.

Better Regulation Minister Kevin Anderson said his department was doing what it could to inform real estate agents of their responsibilities, including through ""education programs, campaigns … online and social media outlets"".

However, the chief executive of the Real Estate Institute of NSW (REINSW), Tim McKibbon, disagreed.

REINSW is the peak body for real estate agents and property professionals in NSW.

""For Fair Trading to say they've been out educating agents is wrong, putting it on the website is not education,"" Mr McKibbon said.

Mr McKibbon said that, if the real estate agent hadn't disclosed the order, his guess would be ""they weren't aware of it and their obligation to go and search for it"".

Under New South Wales law, he said, agents know they are required to disclose building defects, but there's also no clarity around how or when.

""Do you disclose in the marketing material? We don't have guidance,"" he said.

It's also unclear if information buried in strata documents made available to the buyer, such as the minutes of the last annual general meeting held by the owners corporation (formerly body corporate), counts as disclosure by the agent.

A spokesperson for Toplace said the works at Atmosphere required to lift the prohibition order were ""minor and will be completed in a matter of months"".

Merhis Group was contacted for comment.

2021-10-28,ABC,https://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2021-10-27/covid-lockdown-metal-health-resilience/100567736,2021-10-26,"How Australians coped with COVID lockdown, and what they're looking forward to next - ABC News","Like many people, Stella Franzese began Victoria's first COVID-19 lockdown feeling energised to make the most out of what felt like a temporary pause on life.

""I was doing things left, right and centre,"" the 28-year-old psychologist says.

""I learned to knit, took up roller skating, organised the house, took an Auslan course online, organised virtual catch-ups and made homemade ice cream and pasta.

""And amongst all that, I was working. As a psychologist, my work hasn't stopped.""

But the novelty of lockdown soon began to wear off.

By the time the second wave of the pandemic rolled around, Stella, like many others, was feeling burnt out.

""Engaging with clients via telehealth was taxing, virtual catch-ups when it didn't feel authentic anymore was taxing … and not even knowing where my future was headed was taxing,"" she says.

Stella decided to slow down, and by doing so, discovered a ""wonderful new hobby"" that she plans to stick with long after the pandemic ends.

""One morning I decided to get up early to watch the sunrise at [a nearby] lighthouse and take a walk along the beach … it was breathtaking,"" she says.

""This became a routine and a religion for me. Rain, hail or shine, I was getting up early and going for these sunrise walks before work.

""I found it equal parts mindful and energising for the day.""

From the early morning walks emerged another hobby: nature photography.

""Along my walks, the sights are amazing, and I would just try to capture what I saw and how I felt,"" Stella says.

For many people, daily walks have become an important ritual during the past 18 months.

Last month, we asked Australians to share how they've coped during lockdown, and what they're most looking forward to as restrictions are lifted.

Like Stella, Tasmanian man Andrew Bishop found COVID-19 lockdowns and an unexpected illness in his family prompted the beginning of a new hobby.

""During lockdown, my partner contracted an autoimmune disease and we were looking around for very unprocessed foods that would suit her palate,"" Andrew says.

""I found some videos on YouTube on making cheese with a view to making some mozzarella and ricotta … something that she could eat without burning her tongue.""

After organising the necessary equipment and reading a few how-to guides, Andrew turned his garage into a cheese-making workshop.

""It's become the most wonderful hobby,"" he says.

""My most recent cheese is an incredibly hairy blue cheese called the Buttermilk Blue.

""It tastes wonderful, but smells a bit like death or something gone bad.""

University of Sydney research fellow Marlee Bower says for some people, the pandemic has served as a ""circuit breaker"" — a chance to take stock of their lives and re-evaluate what was and wasn't working.

Since June 2020, Dr Bower and her colleagues have followed more than 2,000 people aged 18-88 across the country as they moved in and out of COVID-19 lockdowns.

""We found that lots of people really enjoyed lockdown because it meant a stop to the way they were doing things before,"" Dr Bower says.

""People made really big life changes, like moving to the country or changing jobs.

""People also talked about an increased sense of community because for the first time … they were spending time meeting with neighbours on the street.""

But for others, the pandemic brought uncertainty, stress and isolation, especially for those who lost work.

Dr Bower says Australians' experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic had been largely shaped by where and how people live.

""We're all in the same storm, yet we're in really different boats,"" she says.

""For instance, we found that when you live in housing that has low access to natural light or has more building defects … your mental health was much worse during the lockdown and afterwards.

""On the flip side, living in housing where you felt like you had a strong sense of community and neighbourhood belonging was protective against loneliness, depression and anxiety.""

Research shows COVID-19 exacerbated existing health inequalities, causing additional financial stress and reduced social support.

In August, Lifeline recorded its busiest day ever, fielding nearly 3,500 calls in a 24-hour period.

""We know that most of the mental health issues from COVID aren't new, but really an exacerbation of existing problems or triggers,"" Dr Bower says.

Dr Bower's research also found many people's friendship networks had shrunk during lockdown, leaving some people to feel left out and disconnected, even as restrictions eased.

""This was often the case with males who we know tend to socialise more as part of activities like sports groups … and also those who tend to rely on kind of incidental community connections,"" she says.

""COVID has really highlighted the importance of socialising and community.""

For Rianna Shoemaker, the feeling of being cut off from your social circle because of COVID-19 is all too familiar.

Rianna was living with her partner in Brisbane before she relocated to Melbourne for a new job in July, two days before the city's longest lockdown.

""I was completely isolated for about four months … it was the hardest challenge I've ever experienced,"" she says.

""I am a very strong person … but not being able to see anyone, not being able to have a hug was incredibly difficult.""

This year has also been tough, Rianna says, but one thing that's helped has been widening her support network.

""Now I get help from professionals — I found a really good GP in Melbourne,"" she says.

She says getting out in nature and keeping active have been ""important methods of self-care"" during the past 18 months.

""I do handstand classes once a week after work,"" Rianna says.

""I find that booking in for a time and putting that money down is a really good way to motivate me to get my body moving.""

With millions of Australians now emerging from lockdown, many people are busy filling their social calendars and enjoying the return of parties, gyms, dance floors and communal worship.

For many, it seems reconnecting with friends and family remains at the top of the priority list.

""I'm really looking forward to long drives down to the beach, and up to visit my kids who live in northern and western Victoria. Getting on a plane some time, flying up to Surfers [Paradise] to visit another daughter and see all my family -- having the freedom to just go and have a coffee with my sister."" — Dassana, Melbourne

""Weddings, birthdays, newborns … I just can't wait to be able to hang out with my friends and family without restrictions and to be able to do the things that make me feel whole again."" — Roxanne, Melbourne

For Stella Franzese, it's the ability to make plans — without worrying that they might fall through — that will come as the most welcome change.

""The thing that I'm most looking forward to is not feeling like having a sense of hope or thinking positively about the future is a gamble,"" she says.

""I'm looking forward to having the freedom to go and catch some more beautiful sunrises in even more beautiful places.""

2021-10-28,ABC,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-10-12/sa-family-driven-out-of-new-home-by-mould/100532074,2021-10-12,Father of six buys new home only to be driven into caravan by mould - ABC News,"When Joe Treagus bought a new house on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula a year ago he did not expect to end up living with his wife and six kids in a caravan.

Mould has infiltrated the front wall of the house and the ensuite and, with its smell permeating every room, Mr Treagus felt he could not put his family – including a week-old baby – at risk.

""Basically this winter it showed up, and then it's progressed really quickly,"" he said.

""I can't live here, I can't put my children or my partner in there, so we're in the caravan.""

Mr Treagus's doctor said the mould could be related to the health issues the family suffered since the mould appeared.

""I've had a couple of pest management people come through and both picked up it's a health risk,"" he said.

""One cleaner has been out here and he's knocked the job back — says he can't clean it, that it's too far gone.

""We've had a painter come around and say he couldn't paint the outside wall because of the wetness and the damage.""

The property was less than a year old when the family made the purchase and Mr Treagus said there was ""no sign of damage"".

He said the issue was related to the way the house was built.

""It's on stilts and meant to have vents, and water's not meant to pool,"" Mr Treagus said.

""But it's got a big wood bearer at the front — our house is on a hill, the water runs down, hits that wood and that's floor-level.

""It's just sucked it up like a straw.""

SA Commissioner for Consumer Affairs Dini Soulio said new home buyers had some avenues recourse if problems emerged.

""If a property's less than five years old the builder of the house still has obligations to remedy any building defects under what's called the Building Work Contractors Act,"" Mr Soulio said.

""Your first step is to go back to the builder and say, 'I've noticed these defects' … and preferably put that in writing.

""If you don't get any joy with the building, come to my office and we can see if we can resolve that for people.""

Mr Soulio said one of the most important things for all buyers was to get a building inspection.

""You might go back to the purchaser and say, 'I've got a building inspection — it says that I need to spend $20,000 doing something' and try to renegotiate the price,"" he said.

Mr Soulio said his office was looking into Mr Treagus's case.

Mr Treagus urged new home buyers to cover their bases before committing to a property.

""I'd definitely recommend having an independent assessment before buying,"" he said.

""From experience, definitely get an assessment, have someone go over it and that just so you don't get caught out.

""You don't want to end up like this, living in a caravan — it's not great.""

2021-10-28,ABC,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-09-03/bayview-apartments-plagued-by-defects-for-over-a-decade/100429852,2021-09-03,Owners of Bayview Apartments in Ryde fix defects after developer goes into liquidation - ABC News,"A group of apartment owners in Sydney's north has had to find millions of dollars to rectify defects in their complex which emerged since it was completed 10 years ago.

The developer behind the project — 82-84 Belmore Street Pty Ltd — was liquidated two years after the apartments were built.

The four buildings between Belmore and Porter Streets in Ryde, known as the Bayview Apartments, contain about 350 units and were completed in 2010.

It is the latest apartment complex in Greater Sydney revealed to have left owners out of pocket due to defects within the first few years of settlement.

The owners estimate it has cost them several million dollars to rectify the defects over the past decade. 

Among the problems to emerge was a plastic hot water pipe system in buildings C and D that had to be replaced with a copper network in 2018, costing $2.8 million between about 150 unit owners.

Burst pipes in the buildings set unit-owners back more than $132,000 over four years before they were replaced.

Owners also spent more than $70,000 on repairs in the basement of Building D to fix drainage problems, more than $90,000 to repair render on the same building and $20,000 to rectify communication seals across several buildings because of a fire-spread risk.

Many of the issues were documented in a building defect report commissioned about five years after the buildings were completed.

While the report listed the defects it did not determine who was responsible for them.

Problems with the air-conditioning system was more recently documented in a series of reports provided to the owners corporations, showing it is set to cost owners thousands of dollars.

Strata chair Andrew Murray said many owners were frustrated.

""We are determined to make this building good,"" he said.

""For 20 years, NSW governments allowed builders to thrive through poor regulation.

""They are only just beginning to get their act together.""

Mr Murray said the extra costs had put a big strain on residents when they were not expecting any further expenditure.

""The hot water and the air-conditioning costs were a tremendous shock,"" he said.

""Many of these people are ordinary young families with their mortgages and not much extra cash.

""I feel terribly sad for the young families and even retired pensioners who have bought in and have very little extra money to meet those sudden expenses.""

Investigations by the owners corporations to pursue the developer for any alleged responsibility, found it was highly unlikely legal action could proceed because the company had been wound-up and the warranty period for the buildings had expired.

It was developed by 82-84 Belmore Street Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Holdmark Group and formerly directed by prominent Sydney Developer Sarkis Nassif.

The company was liquidated in 2012, about two years after the buildings were completed.

Mr Nassif is the founder and director of Holdmark Holdings.

A recent investigation commissioned by the Bayview Apartment strata managers, found early attempts to ask parent company Holdmark for help with water-proofing issues in the basement in 2012 only resulted in the installation of drip-trays.

Under new laws which came into effect in July, developers are compelled to rectify serious defects on apartment buildings within 10 years.

A spokesperson for Holdmark said it was willing to work with the owners corporations but claimed it had received little feedback.

It also said the issues raised with it were outside the warranty period.

""Holdmark has a reputation built on quality and a strong history of working constructively with owners and tenants to resolve any issues,"" they said.

""The building in question was completed in 2010 and has been occupied for more than a decade.

""After completion we worked constructively with the owners corporation to undertake rectification works.

""Much of the work undertaken was outside of the relevant warranty period but we were more than happy to assist the owners corporation.""

The spokesperson said at the end of the six-year warranty period, the owners corporation commissioned a building report detailing a range of building and ""wear and tear maintenance issues of a lived-in apartment complex"". 

""We engaged an independent consultant to review the report and to work with the owners corporation to assess and work through any issues,"" he said. 

""We attempted to arrange times to conduct joint inspections of the building and start this process but received no response."" 

Holdmark declined to provide ABC News with a list of items it helped to rectify on behalf of 82-84 Belmore Street Pty Ltd.

The Holdmark Group has more recently completed a number of other residential projects in nearby Meadowbank.

NSW Shadow Minister for Better Regulation Courtney Houssos is one of seven parliamentarians conducting a review into the ""Regulation of building standards and disputes"".

She said more still needed to be done to protect apartment buyers across the state.

""You have more protection buying a $100 appliance than a $1 million dollar property in Sydney,"" she said.

""Buying an apartment in Sydney should bring joy and financial security, not heartbreak and financial ruin.

""The plight of the Bayview Apartment owners shows the system is broken and needs fixing urgently.""

The 35-year-old teacher and her husband Alan did their due diligence and knew there were some fire safety issues before they bought their home in Melbourne's south-east in 2018.

But they didn't realise just how serious the issues were until they moved in, nor were they prepared to be told their home was covered in flammable cladding.

At one stage, the Robertsons said the fire alarm screaming ""evacuate now"" would randomly go off weekly and it happened so frequently that it was like ""crying wolf"".

""When the fire system wasn't operational, and people weren't taking it seriously, that was really stressful,"" Ms Robertson said.

They later received a notice from the Victorian Building Authority saying their building was ""a danger to the life, safety or health"" of residents and clad with combustible expanded polystyrene.

Earlier this year, the Victorian government banned flammable aluminium composite panels and rendered expanded polystyrene for use as external wall cladding for all new multi-storey developments.

But the ban came too late for the Noble Park couple who saved for more than 10 years to buy their first home.

""We're not in a position either financially, or in our accommodation where we can start to have kids,"" Ms Robertson said.

""We're in this two-bedroom apartment that we can't sell on, we don't feel like we can rent it out at the moment, because we know that it's not safe.""

In 2019, the state government committed $600 million to remove combustible cladding from 100 higher-risk residential buildings each year for five years.

Cladding Safety Victoria (CSV) was established to oversee the process.

So far, 25 residential buildings have been completed and about 200 will either be completed or underway by the end of this month.

There are also 112 government-owned buildings in scope for cladding rectification. Sixty-two have been completed, 17 are underway and the remaining 33 are in design and tender stages.

CSV has promised to help pay for the replacement of the cladding on the Robertsons' apartment block, but only if the owners address a list of defects and other conditions that can add hundreds of thousands of dollars to the repair bill.

But any defects beyond combustible cladding are not covered by CSV.

""It's a constant stress for us,"" Ms Robertson said.

""We don't know what's underneath. There's hidden costs there that we don't know about yet.""

Paul Cummaudo, director of building consultants Roscon, compared cladding removal to ""opening a can with no label on it"".

""As far as I know, very few builders are interested in doing this type of work because … they don't know what's involved and what's behind those walls,"" he said.

Mr Cummaudo said many of the buildings had water ingress issues and builders might also find non-compliant framing, a lack of insulation and bad piping among a list of potential problems.

A Frankston South apartment block which was found to have combustible cladding in late 2018 is still waiting for works to start.

According to a resident, they're struggling to find a builder because of the complexities with so many building defects.

On the opposite side of the city, first homeowner Sarah Chambers is also living a cladding nightmare.

In 2019, she fought two other buyers at auction to win the keys to her Pascoe Vale apartment.

She did all her homework and even paid $1,000 for a cladding inspection company to inspect her unit, but still ended up buying a home in a problematic building.

The Victorian Building Authority (VBA) advised her several months later that they had inspected the property and found combustible cladding around other parts of the building.

Ms Chambers said CSV was last in touch about a year ago, but she is still in the dark about the next steps.

CSV said a building in Pascoe Vale was not a priority for funding at this stage, given it was not as high of a risk compared to other buildings in its program.

""I thought it was going to be a really enjoyable experience and a happy time in my life, and it turned out to be a time full of anxiety and stress,"" Ms Chambers said.

The VBA said more than 3,200 private and public buildings have been inspected as part of ongoing the Statewide Cladding Audit.

""We're also inspecting thousands of properties under construction each year as part of our Proactive Inspection Program, which identifies non-compliance early,"" VBA executive director of regulatory operations Lynda McAlary-Smith said in a statement.

The VBA are looking at apartment buildings with three storeys or more constructed after March 1997 as part of the review.

It said prospective buyers should contact them ""as soon as possible"" to check if the property they want to buy has been audited.

Buyers can also contact their local council's planning department or municipal building surveyor and ask if the building has any cladding or fire safety issues.

Ms Robertson said there should also be a change in the way people ""do business around home ownership"".

""The system is broken, it's not protecting people,"" she said.

""If you go to a shop and something's defective, you take it back or there's a product recall, the business pays for it, not the person who bought it.""

A government spokesman said the government had appointed an expert advisory panel to provide recommendations on reforming the building approval process and to better protect consumers.

Two of Toplace's three Riviera apartment towers on River Road in West Parramatta were finished in mid-2018 but just months after settlement, the building's body corporate lodged action in the Supreme Court against the developers.

The body corporate claimed more than 40 types of defects were found, including corroding concrete and defective installation of windows, doors, bathtubs and toilets.

Toplace is the same developer behind the $260 million Skyview towers complex in Castle Hill, currently under review by its private certifier after concerns of alleged ""defects"" were noticed by Fair Trading officers who inspected the construction site in April.

The Riviera and Skyview apartments are among more than a dozen Sydney based projects built by Toplace in the last decade.

The body corporate, representing the owners of about 320 residential lots across the three Riviera towers, first launched action in the Supreme Court in November 2018.

The owners are seeking damages, interest and costs as part of the building dispute claim.

A total of 45 separate types of defects were listed by solicitors representing the body corporate in a 'Technology and Construction List' tendered to the court.

The list covers issues across six categories including acoustic, fire and life safety, hydraulic, electrical and mechanical matters, as well as other general building defects like incorrectly installed doors, concrete wall panels, expansion joints as well as bathtubs, hand basins and toilets.

Other defects claims relate to the installation of plasterboard walls, waterproofing of bathrooms and defective installation of internal water pipes in the laundry.

The body corporate claims Toplace and its subsidiary Parariver Pty Ltd failed in their “duty of care” to ensure the buildings were compliant and fit for use and argue owners deserve to be awarded the costs suffered to identify the alleged problems and any rectification work needed.

The statement claims the body corporate could not inspect the common property before becoming the registered proprietor of the building and therefore could not take steps to ""protect itself"" from the existence of the defective work.

The court has extended the time for the parties to enter into an informal settlement process to June 25, 2021, with the next hearing set down in the Supreme Court in early July.

The company, directed by prominent developer Jean Nassif, is also behind several significant projects currently in the pipeline, including the $250 million Box Hill City Centre redevelopment and at least four other large proposals across Parramatta, Zetland and Mascot.

ABC News has approached Toplace for comment.

2021-10-28,ABC,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-04-30/perth-apartment-owners-left-holding-bill-after-developers-fold/100105106,2021-04-30,Perth apartment owners call for fund to repair apartment defects when developers bail out - ABC News,"Glass balconies blown in by the wind. A privacy screen falling from four stories onto a car. Unsealed windows letting in winter storms.

These are just some of the problems that have arisen in Bev Mainstone's North Coogee apartment block since she bought it off the plan five years ago.

Her building consists of a ground floor car park with three levels of apartments above.

The car park is significant because it makes the building more than three storeys, the height at which developers are not required to take out builder's indemnity insurance.

While the building is still covered by a six-year statutory warranty period, in the first year, when the problems first began to emerge, the developer went into receivership, and was unable to fund repairs or compensate owners.

Ms Maidstone told ABC Radio Perth's Nadia Mitsopoulos she was concerned about what other defects might arise in the future.

""Our strata council employed an independent building inspector who confirmed numerous defects and gradually we are getting them fixed up, but they are quite serious,"" she said.

""Balcony floors need new membranes to stop water ingress. There are so many.""

Ms Maidstone estimated the owners had already spent $50,000 on repairs.

""My concern is problems in years to come,"" she said.

Sam Reece is the chief executive of WA Apartment Advocacy, which advises apartment owners on what to look out for.

While WA has not experienced high profile apartment issues like those in the Opal Towers and Mascot Towers in Sydney, she said there was a looming problem in the state.

She has identified 26 buildings with 1,600 owners that are affected by problems where the developers have gone into receivership and would not be able to honour the six-year building warranty.

""One building has to replace the cladding at a cost of $900,000. This is within the six year statutory warranty period,"" Ms Reece said.

""Another building where all the glass is defective will cost $1.2 million to replace.""

Ms Reece is arguing that the state government should introduce a 2 per cent levy on all new apartment buildings that would build a fund that could pay out in the event of poor construction and developers going into receivership.

""That works in other states,"" she said.

""That means that there is actually a kitty provided on an ongoing basis, where that 2 per cent of construction [costs] goes into the fund.""

While the cost of the fund would likely be passed on to buyers, she said it would provide peace of mind to people purchasing apartments.

""You see apartments going up everywhere, but how are we actually going to protect them and give them confidence that what they are buying is actually going to be provided with some kind of cover?"" Ms Reece said.

""These people have been left in a state of purgatory and the government has turned their back on them.""

For existing apartment owners facing unexpected repairs, Ms Reece is arguing the state government should dip into its Real Estate Fidelity Fund, funded by real estate agent registration fees and currently holding $50 million.

""That needs to be put to some use and this is the perfect use for it,"" she said.

ABC Radio Perth listeners also shared stories of apartment construction woes.

Jack: ""Repairs cost me $10k after the builder went into liquidation. Water membranes not in place causing extensive damage at a four-storey apartment in Scarborough.""

Emma: ""The Government should not keep pushing increased density and more apartments without fixing this! These people did not build the apartment, sign off on the work, but have to live with the problems and pay to fix.""

Paul: ""I bought off the plan about 10 years ago. I thought it would be like buying a new car and there would be a warranty if anything went wrong. It was quite the reverse. We really had to fight the developer. Given the fact that Australia is going to have more apartments this has to be taken more seriously to give people confidence to buy.""

In a statement, a state government spokesperson said the government was ""committed to a productive building industry that delivered high standards of housing and commercial construction whilst ensuring affordability remained a key focus"".

However it does not support using $50 million in a real estate fidelity account to fund apartment repairs.

""Funds in the Fidelity Guarantee Account (FGA) protect buyers impacted by fraud or misappropriation committed by licensed real estate or business agents, real estate settlement or business settlement agents in the course of a real estate settlement or business broking transaction,"" they said.

""The state government does not support repurposing the FGA funds to repair building defects.

""The majority of builders do the right thing and the introduction of additional bond schemes and levies would likely have a significant impact on affordability.""

Robyn Cairnes and her two children, aged 10 and 14, are now living in a caravan in the front courtyard of their house in Wembley due to health issues including joint pain, rashes, serious headaches and chronic fatigue.

They have moved out of the house several times for short periods, but moved out for good earlier this year after consulting a specialist doctor.

""It's been trying but we know that the house is poisonous and we can't be in there,"" Ms Cairnes told ABC Radio Perth.

""My daughter actually walked into the side of the house where the bathroom is and she immediately got rashes last night.

""We can't be in the house without getting sick.""

Ms Cairnes said a building inspector who carried out an investigation found a defective faulty waterproof membrane in one of the showers in the house.

She said there was also no waterproof membrane in the other shower.

The sole parent has been pressing the builder, Ventura Homes, to fix the problem since 2016 when she first complained about a mould smell in the house.

Ventura Homes is no longer operating, but BGC Housing Group, which took over the company earlier this year, said it had carried out ""relatively minor"" remediation work at the family's house following a ruling from the State Administrative Tribunal.

""BGC prides itself on the quality of the homes we build for Western Australians and all our homes are covered by a lifetime structural warranty,"" the company said in a statement.

It also said it had paid an additional amount in compensation to Ms Cairnes.

But Ms Cairnes said the amount of about $14,300 came nowhere near to covering how much the problem had cost her in the past four years.

She said she had so far borrowed about $150,000 to pay for alternative accommodation, along with mould inspections and reports.

A building inspector with 45 years' experience, who assessed the remedial work in June, found that it had not been completed in a proper manner and ""could only be described as totally unacceptable"".

Since then, Ms Cairnes has made a further complaint about what she claims is another major defect, discovered by a plumber.

""I asked the plumber to take the bath up and there's a large hole in the slab and there's no waterproof membrane under that slab,"" she said.

""And there is a mould-contaminated, swampy, wet soil that we have been breathing in for four-and-a-half years.""

An assessment of the property by a specialist laboratory, Mycolab, in October strongly recommended remediation, reporting ""low-moderate"" to ""high"" levels of fungal concentrations in the house.

Ms Cairnes said both her daughter and son had ended up in hospital due to their illnesses.

""All the doctors told me it was not the mould that could be making my daughter so sick,"" she said.

""But a couple of months later, my son ended up in hospital.

""I put him to bed one night, he said he had a terrible earache.

""After half an hour, he had a temperature of 40.5 and his whole left side of his face had swollen up.""

Finally, Ms Cairnes went to a specialist physician, who she said had advised the family to get out of the house.

In its statement, BGC said it would carry out more work at the house if the Building Commission believed there were issues that still needed to be addressed.

""Naturally we will gladly undertake this work,"" the company said.

""However, BGC is of the firm position that it has complied with the SAT orders and that no further works are required.""

Ms Cairnes's lawyer, John Hammond, said his client was one of three taking action over similar issues.

He said he was exploring avenues for a damages claim related to the health impacts.

""It's increasingly a growing area for all the wrong reasons,"" Mr Hammond told ABC Radio Perth.

""I think it's a question of time before someone goes to the courts and gets a ruling on it.""

Ms Cairnes believes she and her family have been suffering from a condition called Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome, which is thought to be caused by mould or moisture damage in homes.

In October 2018, a federal parliamentary committee handed down a report calling for more research into CIRS and related conditions and how prevalent they were in Australia.

""We put all our savings in there,"" he said, looking up at his apartment in the infamous Mascot Towers complex in Sydney's inner south.

Late one Friday evening in June 2019, just two months after Mr dos Santos purchased the property for close to $1 million, he and the building's other residents were rushed out in an emergency evacuation after significant cracks appeared in its support system.

A year and a half — and millions of dollars — later, residents are still in temporary accommodation, with the building still not safe to live in, and no closer to knowing just when they will be able to move back in. 

""We can't plan, we have no future,"" Mr dos Santos said.

Because Mascot Towers was almost 12 years old when the defects appeared, it fell outside of the NSW warranty period for apartment buildings, which is six years.

To make matters worse, the developer later went into liquidation.

It is now Mascot Towers' individual apartment owners who have been left to foot the hefty repair bill, which documents show could exceed $50 million.

That is in addition to the legal fees and ongoing levies, utility bills and mortgages, which apartment owner Anthony Najafian says has left him ""drowning in debt"".

""We're in a situation which we didn't create but we have to suffer for,"" he said.

The owners of Mascot Towers are now suing the developers and builders of Peak Towers, the property next door, for $15 million, alleging excavation work during the construction of the building caused the cracks in Mascot Towers.

Court documents show there are four defendants listed. All were contacted and either did not respond or declined to comment.

However, in those court documents, the developer Church 88 and the builder Aland Development ""deny these allegations and say that any damage to Mascot Towers has been caused by pre-existing building defects"".

With bills and debts mounting and owners unable to sell the uninhabitable apartments, some residents like Mr dos Santos and Mr Najafian are now calling on the NSW Government to buy Mascot Towers back from residents.

""I think the problem was born from the Government's laws and decisions,"" Mr Najafian said.

""The best thing would be for the Government to acquire the land or repurpose the land, and to give us a fresh break in life, to give us a renewed chance to live again.""

In a statement, a spokesperson for the NSW Government Minister for Better Regulation and Innovation Kevin Anderson said the government had no plans to buy the property.

""We appreciate the difficult situation faced by the owners of Mascot Towers,"" the spokesperson said. 

""The NSW Government continues to provide extensive financial support to owners and tenants and has also made available independent technical advice to help the owners determine what works are needed before the building can be re-occupied.""

While Mascot Towers residents are thankful for temporary rental assistance, some feel the NSW Government has not done enough to support them.

""I put all my life savings into a Mascot Towers apartment and paid my taxes, have always tried to do the right thing. And I have been badly let down by what can only be described as a failing system"", Mr Najafian said.

In response to the sagas at Opal and Mascot Towers, the NSW Government appointed David Chandler as the state's Building Commissioner and introduced new regulations aimed at preventing another Mascot Towers occurring.

But that has been little comfort to Mascot Towers residents.

""He's doing quite a bit for the new developments. But the sentiment we have is he left us behind,"" Mr dos Santos said.

""Because we saw the documents, the changes for the future, looking forward, but nobody is looking backwards … and we are 100 per cent left behind in this case, because we didn't see any changes for us. It's not good enough.""

Mr Najafian agreed.

""Look, I think there'll be a great benefit to apartment owners moving forward. But for us being stuck in the middle, I don't feel enough is being done,"" he said.

Mr Chandler declined to comment.

Mascot Towers was not the first Sydney high-rise apartment block to face major structural defects. 

Months earlier, on Christmas Eve 2018, residents of Opal Tower were also forced to flee after cracks appeared in the building, sparking concerns it could collapse.

However, unlike Mascot Towers, Opal Tower was just two years old when the defects appeared, well within the warranty period, and its builder Icon carried out all repairs and provided financial support to residents until they moved back in last year.

Residents are now suing Icon and the NSW Government's Sydney Olympic Park Authority for what they say are hundreds of other defects that have been discovered in the building. Owners have also launched a separate class action.

In a statement, Icon said that following their extensive repair work they believe ""the structural integrity of Opal Tower is to a standard higher than most buildings in Australia"".

The company said they ""did everything we could to minimise the impact on residents"".

""As a result of the measures taken by Icon and the financial assistance provided to the owners to date, owners have been generously compensated for any losses arising out of the damage in the Opal Tower,"" Icon said.

Opal Tower resident Shady Eskander has become the main public spokesman for the building's apartment owners and, now, owners across the broader industry.

""The building industry has been allowed to go about building in such a manner unregulated, without peer review, without any accountability. And that ultimately will result in defects. So we do believe it is a legislative issue and therefore that lies on the government,"" he said.

""I think Opal and Mascot have brought it to light to show that there is a real underlying issue with these high-rise residential apartments.""

""We don't actually know the true extent of how many towers have major defects behind their walls. Only time will ultimately show that.""

He believes consumers are being left to ""fend for themselves"" and is calling for greater consumer protection, proposing a process of mandated peer review on new construction projects as well as a clause on new building purchase contracts that would hold the developer liable for major faults and entitle buyers to a refund.

""Right now we are the ones that have to find the defect, pay for the defect to be assessed, pay for the lawyers to put together arguments as to why it is a defect, pay for it to be rectified,"" Mr Eskander said.

""We're doing it backwards, we're trying to put in place the protection after the defects have occurred. We need to put in place the protection before the defects have occurred.""

Kathlyn Loseby, president of the NSW chapter of the Australian Institute of Architects, is part of a group of stakeholders calling for stronger regulations.

""We can see over the last 10, maybe 15 years that there's been a decrease in the amount of red tape, let's call it. And so what that means is less legislation, less requirements for a certain amount of documentation,"" she said.

""I think also our trades have actually diminished over a period of time. So I think the whole point here is we've got to actually lift our training ability.""

Recognising the skills gap in the industry, global developing giant Multiplex has taken matters into its own hands, establishing their own training centre in Sydney to upskill their subcontractors and builders.

7.30 spoke to Meg Redwin, one of Multiplex's executive directors and their general counsel in the facility.

Multiplex has no connection to Mascot or Opal towers.

Ms Redwin believes that overall, the industry is adequately regulated and Mascot and Opal towers are not reflective of the wider industry.

""I think it's such a small proportion of the market,"" she said.

""Like in anything, there are people who play on the edges … But Australia as an industry has a very strong building industry.""

""Without a doubt, in any boom, you end up with a supply chain that gets stretched or weakened. And construction is pretty low-price to enter.""

She believes consumer protection for apartment buyers is adequate.

""The residential market, in particular, is really heavily regulated. And I see that in NSW, in Queensland, Victoria in WA … I think it is well-regulated"".

Ms Redwin has advice for Australians considering buying a new apartment: ""I would do due diligence. And I would ask the developer who the builder was, and I'd ask to go and see what the builder has previously delivered. I think that's a really sensible thing to do.""

""Reputation is really important,"" she said.

2021-10-28,ABC,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-09-04/logan-house-built-touching-next-door-builder-certifier-concerns/12622408,2020-09-03,"Houses built so close in Logan, their roofs and gutters touch - ABC News","Queensland couple Nina and Wayne Austin worked hard to get their first home, but their dream has quickly turned into a nightmare.

""No other home is like this … there are other homes that are close, but not like ours,"" Mrs Austin said.

Months after moving into their four-bedroom, two-bathroom house in a development at Holmview in Logan, south of Brisbane, the neighbouring home was built — it was so close their gutters touched.

""The roof and gutters were touching and pushing ours. They shaved off a few millimetres, but it's not right,"" she said.

""People walk past, and they say, 'Oh wow, what's happened there?', in disgust.

""We feel like the investment for the future for our kids is gone, that we are not safe, we feel ripped off.""

The Austins said their builder had to change the approved building plans and flip the garage to the other side of the property to fit on their block.

The couple trusted the builder and the certifier, who approved the changes.

But 10 months after moving in, they realised the house next door was being built unusually close.

""I work in the construction game. When they started putting the slab down on the empty lot next door, I was worried,"" Mr Austin said.

The pair raised the issue with Logan City Council, only to be told the neighbour's house was legal and it was their home that should not have been certified.

The couple have spent the past six months reaching out to the builder and certifier, but no one has admitted fault.

""Our trust was in the builder and certifier, 100 per cent, it's their job to get these things right. If they can't get it right, they've got to fix it — simple,"" Mr Austin said.

The couple have two young children and are living on a single income.

Mrs Austin says it has been emotionally and financially exhausting.

""We just wanted a house where we could have a yard for the kids. This was just a stepping stone to get into the market, so we could hopefully sell in a few years and get the house we wanted. I don't know how we are going to sell now,"" she said.

""It doesn't feel like our home anymore because you don't know what's going to happen.""

The pair applied for insurance through the Queensland Building and Construction Commission (QBCC), but were told they were not eligible for the home warranty scheme because it was a planning issue and not a building defect.

They have filed a second complaint against the certifier, which is still being investigated.

Property lawyer Bronwyn Weir said even if the certifier was at fault, the watchdog could only suspend their licence — it would not get the Austins any financial compensation.

""The owner shouldn't be expected to understand the potential planning implications of agreeing to [move the garage] … it should have always been referred back to the certifier and authorities,"" Ms Weir said.

She said taking the builder or certifier to court was the family's only real option, but also a risky one.

""Even the simplest of claims will cost tens of thousands of dollars, and even the most watertight cases can fail because there are so many factors that go into a building dispute,"" she said.

""It's important to get advice because it costs a lot of money to pursue a legal action, it's very stressful and emotional, and at some point you need to put a price on that and ask whether it's worth it.

""I have dozens of people who have been completely crushed by the experience of court proceedings, even if they get a favourable outcome.""

Ms Weir said the couple's situation raised the question as to whether the Queensland home warranty scheme should be expanded to take in planning issues such as theirs.

""There may be an argument that the insurance should cover this, so it might be worth speaking to the QBCC again about that, firstly,"" she said.

""If the warranty scheme doesn't cover it, there's a policy question there as to whether the insurance should only cover building defects, or should it also cover planning issues?""

With many Australians taking advantage of state and federal first-home buyer grants on offer to stimulate the construction sector, Ms Weir said it was especially important for those building a new home to be as involved as possible in the construction.

""Often owners find it easier to let the builder deal with compliance issues and deal with the certifier, but they should ask to be a part of inspections and deal with the certifier directly,"" she said.

""It's becoming more common for owners to engage their own expert as well, to conduct inspections. 

""It offers additional protection, and a good builder shouldn't be threatened by an owner who is interested in these things.

""It's a small price to pay because rectifying defects is a stressful process.""

Griffith University urban planning expert Tony Matthews said while the Austins' situation was unusual, it was not unique.

""This situation where you have houses on very small blocks that end up butting against their neighbour's or their properties, that's happening all over Australia,"" Dr Matthews said.

""It's not an uncommon problem, particularly in the outer suburbs of major cities.

""Building up to the fence line is just bad practice. It doesn't promote good neighbourliness and it's bad for micro-climates because air can't move around buildings and it creates heat pockets and all kinds of other negative effects.

""It's another reminder: buyer beware. Always make sure everything meets planning regulations, make sure you've got a structural report, a pest report — the more due diligence you do before you put your money down, the better off you'll be,"" Dr Matthews said.

He said Logan City Council could approve the home as built, but the Austins said they did not want to sign anything until their builder or certifier addressed the problem.

""To us, that's just a simple sign your rights away … that's not good enough,"" Mrs Austin said.

""We shouldn't have to go through all this because no one cares.""

Redland Bay residents have voiced their concerns on social media about a new development at a former banana plantation on Broadwater Terrace.

Redlands residents are concerned about a lack of kerb and footpaths in the high-density development, with some homes built just centimetres apart from one another.

Earlier this year, the Austins wrote an emotional letter to Housing Minister Mick de Brenni, asking for his help.

Mr de Brenni told the ABC he could not comment on the Austins' case specifically.

In response to concerns about new houses in Redlands, Mr de Brenni said local governments were in control of planning their cities. 

""Some of those small lot housing developments make those homes affordable … it is the responsibility of councils to make sure they get their planning schemes right,"" Mr de Brenni said.

Logan City Council said the Austins' situation was a matter between them and the builder and certifier, but that it was reviewing its planning scheme.

The ABC has approached the builder and certifier on several occasions. 

Both have refused to comment.

Ernst and Young were appointed as liquidators in January, and 20 staff have lost their jobs.

More than 150 creditors and about 10 projects under development are believed to have been affected. 

Calls to Banyan's Fyshwick office reverts straight to a voice message, while the mobile number for its managing director, Liam Kelly, has been disconnected.

Several creditors, the majority of which are small Canberra businesses, are owed more than $1 million.

The construction union's ACT branch is on the creditors list, but is only owed $484.

CFEMU ACT secretary Jason O'Mara said the financial collapse sent a shockwave through the industry and would be catastrophic for many local companies.

""There's not many companies in town who can cop a million-dollar loss. You need a big bankroll to be able to sustain it,"" he said.

""Very rarely in these circumstances is there much left of any assets left in the business for any of the subcontractors, so they'll be looking at cents in the dollar if they're lucky, if there's anything.

""It's unfortunately all too common for companies to go bust, and subcontractors and workers have to wear the consequences.""

The ACT Master Builders, which is also owed $800 by Banyan, said the concern now was about the secondary collapse of companies owed money by Banyan.

Chief executive Michael Hopkins said the search for replacement builders to complete Banyan projects was crucial to avoid industry disruption, ""so subbies and suppliers can keep on working on these jobs"".

""We would be really concerned about the viability of some of these some of these subbies and suppliers and we'd be working with them closely to get them through this period,"" he said.

The ACT Government last year announced a review of the security of payment scheme in the ACT, which would consider models for protection of payments to subcontractors.

The reforms included the proposed developer licensing scheme, more powers to make company directors personally liable for building defects, as well as higher standards for builders licence exams.

Mr O'Mara said project trust accounts, like those in other jurisdictions, would have helped blunt the financial blow of Banyan's failure.

Under the proposal, developers and builders would be required to set up trust accounts for each project.

Money placed into the account could then only be spent on a specific project.

The accounts are designed to ensure contractors and subcontractors are still paid if a developer or builder goes into liquidation.

""At the moment, there's nothing stopping a builder, back financing projects or forward financing projects,"" Mr O'Mara said.

""We've seen many times where a developer will not pay subcontractors, not pay builders, because they're off buying their next block of land.

""Until they come into some more money, they don't pay anyone, so this thing really needs to be tightened up.""

Mr O'Mara said a developer licensing scheme that did not include project trust accounts would be empty legislation.

""It's a matter of getting a government courageous enough to do the right thing by workers and subcontractors to whack them in,"" he said.

""We need 100 per cent of the money held in trust and people being accountable for paying their bills on time and for work that's been done appropriately.""

But Mr Hopkins said similar schemes operating in Queensland and Western Australia had not prevented corporate collapses.

""While they might sound like an appealing solution, they often don't work,"" he said.

""But we would still be keen to explore all options to make sure that things like this don't happen in the future.

""We need to look beyond just project bank accounts and trust accounts and find other solutions to help this problem.""

The damage is located in the basement of the multi-storey car park with large cracks apparent on three pillars in the south-west corner.

""There's quite severe cracking there, that's a major issue,"" building defects consultant Ross Taylor told the ABC. 

""It's quite fair enough for people to have a heightened awareness, and then ask the question, 'Is this right or is this wrong?'"" he said. 

The damage has been brought to light almost a year after the Opal Tower at Sydney Olympic Park was first evacuated due to cracks there.

Since then, a number of other residential buildings have been found to have major defects, prompting the State Government to appoint a special Building Commissioner to try and clean up the construction industry.

The damage at Revesby was brought to light by an anonymous letter to the ABC titled: 'The Next Opal Tower?'

""Next to the last column, the most serious, was a lump of concrete the size of a house brick, sitting on the floor,"" the letter said.

""It makes me wonder, with all the infrastructure work going on at the moment, and more being planned, who is auditing the builders?""

The Revesby Workers' Club said it was aware of the issue and had already acted.

""As a result of building movement, the two materials are pulling against each other, resulting in cosmetic cracking,"" the club said in a statement.

""We have been advised there is no structural concern.""

The club said remediation works were expected early next year.

Structural Engineer Paul Siewert said the cracking needed to be fixed.

""Defects like this are common in the industry and are usually a result of inadequate engineering details or poor experience with the contractors on site, or a combination of both,"" he told the ABC. 

The car park is a popular parking space for people attending the venue, but also nearby shops and Revesby train station.

When contacted by the ABC, a spokesman for the City of Canterbury Bankstown said it appeared the council had not been informed of the damage, and that an officer would undertake an inspection of the site this morning.

2021-10-28,ABC,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-27/developers-say-ban-targets-wrong-end-of-the-food-chain/11740558,2019-11-27,"Canberra developers say they aren't to blame for bad buildings, as Government plans 'dodgy developer' ban - ABC News","Canberra's developers say a crackdown on company directors wrongly targets the top of the food chain. But the responsible minister has hit back, saying ""the fish rots from the head"" and the Government will push on with its plan to ban ""dodgy"" developers.

Some of Canberra's largest property developers have suggested the ACT Government should stop hassling head office and get out on the construction site if it wants to improve building quality.

The criticism has come in response to proposed laws designed to tackle ""dodgy"" property developers escaping accountability for poor quality work.

Some of the more contentious proposals include a yet-to-be-developed licensing scheme for property developers — the first of its kind in Australia — and laws to make directors liable for penalties and rectification orders, even if their company goes under.

The crackdown has left many of Canberra's property developers perplexed and frustrated.

Barry Morris, the director of the Morris Property Group, argued developers were not to blame for problems around building quality.

""The ACT Government is going the wrong way on the food chain,"" he said.

""They're going up the food chain to developers, but, in fact, I think they should be going the other direction down the food chain to consultants, designers, all the engineering disciplines.""

Mr Morris argued the current approach misunderstood how construction jobs worked, and the relationships held between developers, builders and subcontractors.

He said it was unfair to require developers to carry the risk and be held accountable for the actions of other licensed professionals.

""We don't have an employee-employer relationship,"" he said.

""We have an arm's-length, third-party contract with a builder, and the builder then has arm's-length contracts with designers and subcontractors.

""So I don't agree that it's as simple as saying: 'Because the developer is ultimately the person sitting on top of that pile that he has the knowledge or the expertise to be responsible'.""

A local inquiry into building quality has heard from the industry that some builders and subcontractors feel impossible time and financial pressures were placed on them to complete work, and that they sometimes cut corners as a consequence.

But a spokeswoman for development company Doma Group said that was not realistic.

""The notion that a developer can force a builder to cut corners to save costs is foreign to us, as the builders we use would rightly reject any such pressure,"" she said.

""The call to license developers and make them responsible for building defects to address building quality issues is completely misdirected and disingenuous.""

Mr Morris, who was recently taken to court by the ACT Government over a property in Kingston, also expressed his disdain for the Government's use of the term ""dodgy developers"".

The label has appeared in a number of official government campaigns around the new laws, including the press release announcing the licensing scheme.

""We take offence that the minister would be calling them 'dodgy developers',"" he said.

""The inference is that every developer is dodgy.""

The ACT Government is expected to continue its push to legislate for further financial accountability for property developers this week.

Building Quality Minister Gordon Ramsay said they aimed to hold all levels of the construction industry accountable, from the top down.

""Using the old adage 'the fish rots from the head down', we want to look at the entire process and not just some parts of it,"" he said.

""There are important roles that property developers play in ensuring the quality of building that we have.""

Mr Ramsay rejected suggestions the new regulations might drive high-quality, established developers out of the ACT due to increased risk and over-regulation.

""For developers who are doing the right thing, they've got nothing to fear,"" he said.

""For people who are operating transparently, ethically, making sure that there aren't inappropriate time pressures or financial pressures on builders or others, then there is nothing for them to fear.""

The licensing scheme is still in its infancy, with consultation planned to work out exactly how it will be implemented over the next twelve months.

2021-10-28,ABC,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-13/nsw-report-calls-for-independent-building-commission/11700732,2019-11-13,NSW parliamentary committee report calls for independent building commission to fix construction industry - ABC News,"A parliamentary committee report has called for the establishment of a separate building commission and a dedicated building minister to improve standards across the construction industry in New South Wales.

The first report from the Public Account Committee has made 19 recommendations to the NSW Government in the wake of major structural problems at Mascot Towers and Opal Tower at Sydney Olympic Park.

One of those recommendations is the establishment of a sufficiently resourced building commission which would operate as an ""independent statutory power"" alongside a dedicated building minister to oversee the state's construction industry.

Parliament is currently debating a bill to create a new registration system for the industry, and to make it easier for owners to pursue damages.

But Greens MP David Shoebridge said the government's current piecemeal legislative approach was not enough to address the loss of confidence in the industry.

""Every stakeholder said that this industry needs root and branch reform … this industry needs a single building act that is governed by a senior minister,"" he said.

""But more fundamentally, we can't just rely on the current regulators and the current crop of politicians to make the industry safe.

""We need a building commission, not just a building commissioner.""

The report also calls on the government to extend statutory warranties on building defects to a minimum of seven years to allow home owners to take out comprehensive insurance.

Mr Shoebridge said the government also needed to come up with a proper assistance package for residents affected by flammable cladding as well as structural issues in their buildings.

""We had homeowners in tears about the personal, financial and emotional cost that they are facing,"" he said.

""Individuals who had bought a home expecting the government had standards in place to make that home safe and fit for purpose, and instead finding the government had fled the field.""

Labor's John Graham said while the report only touched on the issue of flammable cladding, the issue would be investigated with a further hearing in December.

""The more we looked at these issues, the more worried we were about the state of apartment building in NSW,"" Mr Graham said.

""The most concerning evidence we received was that the Building Commissioner had advice sitting on the desk of the Minister about how to deal with flammable cladding and today, that has still not been acted on.

""It has been in Victoria — it has not been in NSW. There is no plan to deal with that and we need a plan to deal with flammable cladding on buildings in NSW.""

To cope with the financial stress, some owners have delayed their retirement, while others have borrowed money to cover massive increases in insurance premiums.

Others have told of their concerns for neighbours who may be at risk of suicide because of the impact of the issue.

The information comes from research undertaken by the RMIT's School of Property, Construction and Project Management, conducted by Dr Trivess Moore and Dr David Oswald.

""There is information emerging about the scale of the potential financial costs of combustible cladding,"" Dr Moore told 7.30.

""But what we haven't yet heard is the social impact.

""It's not just the financial effect we need to address — we need to bring the voices of the people impacted and their lived experience into this discussion.

""We have had reports from some of the interviewees that they are concerned that some neighbours they know may be suicidal because of this issue.""

Dr Moore said residents also spoke of their concern about the range of other defects in apartments, including a lack of waterproofing and water ingress.

Residents of a Frankston South building affected by combustible cladding said the issue, as well as a laundry list of other defects in their complex, had caused them major emotional and financial stress.

""I think this has probably been the worst 10 months of my life, putting up with this,"" owner Kerry Ould told 7.30.

""You buy the biggest thing of your life and you have got zip consumer protection. Nothing.

""You have to fight.""

Another owner, Craig Fitch, decided to speak out about the flaws despite being aware that identifying his building could affect its resale value.

""Things need to change,"" he said.

""Sometimes you need to think a little less about yourself and try and get an overall result for the whole of Victoria really.""

Mr Fitch and the other owners at the Frankston South complex will be among the first to benefit from a Victorian Government scheme which pays for the removal of combustible cladding on the building.

But they still face millions of dollars in repairs on other building defects and are now suing the builder to recover costs arising from the disastrous development.

""I've worked with lots and lots of good tradesmen and good builders and they shouldn't be tarred with the same brush but they need to weed them out,"" Mr Fitch said.

""The regulator just needs to get better and get rid of the rubbish out of the industry.""

The Victorian government has put $600 million towards a project to identify and replace dangerous cladding and has vowed to pursue dodgy builders who installed it.

Other states are less advanced, with concerns raised around the delay in action on the issue in NSW.

NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge has been particularly vocal.

""In New South Wales, there's not one cent that's come forward from the state government to help property owners,"" he told 7.30.

""There's no public register, we don't even have a set of guidelines to identify what property owners need to do to make their properties safe.

""This is a problem created by bad government, by deregulation and privatisation. And that's why I believe government has to be part of the solution.""

Mr Shoebridge said the NSW government was refusing to make a register of affected buildings public.

""I find it astounding,"" he said.

""We're two and a half years post that tragedy in Grenfell and we still don't have a public register in New South Wales, we still don't have a comprehensive system to identify buildings at risk of flammable cladding.""

The NSW government has previously advised councils to cite a terror risk to keep flammable cladding locations secret from the public. Many owners also fear the potential hit to the value of their investment, if its cladding status is made public.

Residents in 37 apartment complexes across Sydney have been advised remediation work to remove some or all of the combustible cladding on their buildings will need to take place.

NSW Better Regulation Minister Kevin Anderson said the government was approaching this issue ""practically and diligently"".

""We have prioritised high-rise residential buildings for assessment with local councils, who are making every effort to see assessments done as soon as possible,"" he told 7.30 in a statement.

""Every day we clear more buildings and learn more about the buildings requiring remediation work.

""I want to make it clear, residents are not in any immediate danger as a result of living in one of these buildings. Extra fire safety measures have been put in place to protect residents until buildings can be cleared or remediated.""

7.30 has heard from dozens of Australians who have been hit with huge bills from major building defects, who say they had little to no consumer protection in buying their biggest asset.

""We are seeing more and more defects. And that's due to the products that are being used,"" said Sahil Bhasin, general manager of Roscon, a business that conducts defect reports.

""There's thousands of cases out there, however they just aren't publicised in the media, that's the problem, because they don't result in people being displaced.

""However, when you look at commercial buildings, when you look at factories and you look at domestic dwellings that aren't complete, there are thousands of cases out there.""

The hospital is operated under a public-private partnership, which will see taxpayers make annual payments to a private consortium over a 30-year period.

Those payments were anticipated to be in the range of $360–$400 million per year, but Treasurer Rob Lucas today confirmed those payments had so far been averaged between $285–$310 million.

Mr Lucas said the reduction in cost had been driven by lower interest rates, among other factors.

""There's a bit of good management and some good luck in relation to that as well,"" he said.

Mr Lucas made the admission while announcing the State Government had reached a financial settlement to end a long-running legal dispute with the private consortium which operates the hospital.

He said the in-principle deal, agreed by the consortium Celsus last night, would cost taxpayers an extra $16 million in today's dollars, with payments to be staggered over several years.

He said the settlement to end the dispute had been recommended by all of the State Government's advisers, including the Crown Solicitor and external lawyers.

""It was a lawyers' picnic, costing tens of millions of dollars to all parties,"" Mr Lucas said.

""The prospect was we either continue with more of that at a cost of tens of millions of dollars to all parties, or seek a sensible commercial settlement.""

The legal dispute centres on disagreements over the provision of orderlies, room cleaning, as well as building defects and problems with the hospital's air conditioning. 

Under the settlement, Celsus has agreed to construct two new cooling towers and fix the hospital's duress alarm system, which has been plagued with failures.

The agreement will also see a change in terms for hospital services provider Spotless, which had been losing money. 

In a statement to the ASX, Downer EDI, which owns Spotless, said the agreement included an increase in Spotless's monthly service fee and settled historical claims.

""All parties have worked hard during the settlement discussions to address the various legacy issues and come up with solutions that provide better outcomes for patients,"" Downer Group chief executive Grant Fenn said.

It does not absolve the State Government of any legal responsibility in a separate long-standing arbitration by the hospital builder.

Health Minister Stephen Wade said that arrangement would help reduce costs and improve outcomes for patients.

""It's not in the interests of the hospital as a whole for people … to be waiting for discharge, waiting in their bed to leave, or waiting for the bed to become free after being cleaned,"" Mr Wade said.

""So, we believe that … some of the measures in this agreement will be important for both the hospital and for the patient.""

The in-principle settlement is expected to be concluded next month.

Deputy Opposition Leader Susan Close said a ""very strong contract"" had been put in place with Celsus when Labor was in government. 

""I'm not going to second-guess the legal advice that the Government has received … and this is a very big, very expensive hospital that's doing an excellent job for South Australians, except for the threats that this Government is cutting and cutting and cutting,"" Dr Close said.

Yesterday Four Corners suggested the Elara Apartments in Canberra's north appeared to have been built under a so-called ""design and construct model"", where a well-known architect was enlisted in order for the development to be approved, but removed from the project prior to construction beginning.

After some apartments in the Elara project were sold off the plan, the development's B&T Constructions and its director Ivan Bulum removed an acclaimed architecture firm from the project.

Building defects consultant Ross Taylor told the program it was a common tactic used by developers to have their projects approved, but save money during the construction phase.

""The process of these defects being generated starts right at the beginning with the developer,"" he said.

""The builder, who has no training in design, [then] takes responsibility for the design done to date and completing the last half of the detail.""

But Mr Taylor said, because the builder was operating on a tight budget, subcontractors were frequently asked to finish the designs ""the way they see fit"".

He said that would sometimes lead to tradespeople finishing the design while on the job.

The owners of Elara Apartments are still fighting legal battles to recoup their diminished investments, appealing a Federal Court decision that denied them access to compensation through a fund set up to compensate owners whose builders were insolvent.

Responding to the Four Corners report, ACT Building Quality Minister Gordon Ramsay said the Government should not shoulder responsibility for allowing poor work to be carried out in the first place.

""The responsibility in the building industry, for the quality of building, must always rest with the builder,"" he said.

""That's the reality of the way that it works.""

Mr Ramsay said it was apparent many apartment blocks across Canberra had issues with defects.

""I think it is clear that there have been some builders who have been operating in the ACT and around Australia who are not building to the right level of quality,"" he said.

""There are some times where there has been action that has been taken either by people in the industry, or by building surveyors, that have not been of sufficient quality.

""We are certainly determined, we are following through on a range of reforms in that area, to make sure that as we move forward from here the building that does happen, the certification that does happen, the tradesmanship that does happen, is all of high quality.""

Last year it emerged the Government was well behind its own deadlines for introducing a suite of changes designed to overhaul the Canberra construction industry.

But Mr Ramsay said the Government was hard at work to ensure standards were lifted in the sector.

The Government plans to introduce mandatory education and testing for those seeking registration as a building certifier, and Mr Ramsay said a professional code of practice had also been introduced.

""That now requires them to operate at best practice, not at the lowest minimum that you saw sometimes in the Four Corners report last night,"" he said.

Mr Ramsay said an industry code of practice was also being developed for the building industry, and the Government was exploring the possibility of licencing developers — which would be an Australian first.

The Government also wants those purchasing units off the plan to take more control during the construction process.

It recently announced plans to force developers to notify buyers of major changes to development proposals made during construction but after a sale, allowing buyers to terminate a contract where the final product significantly differed from what they had agreed to purchase.

The Government also wants to hand more power to individual owners through owners corporations — limiting the ability for developers to vote on matters relating to building defects.

But Mr Ramsay said the Federal Government had the most important role to play in cracking down on developers leaving apartment owners high and dry after building defects emerged.

The ACT Government already has the power to strip builders of their licence in order to prevent them building more properties in the ACT.

It has already done so in the Elara case, but could not prevent the builder from re-entering the industry as a developer — launching projects, and contracting the construction out to others.

Despite that, the ACT Government argued it was largely powerless to tackle one of the biggest problems owners face when chasing builders and developers over defects — companies folding, and re-emerging under a different name.

""Phoenixing is something that has to be done at a federal level,"" Mr Ramsay said.

""I, as the ACT Government and a number of state and territory governments have done, call on the Federal Government to act really quickly as a matter of absolute priority.""

But opposition planning spokesman Mark Parton said Mr Ramsay should accept responsibility, on behalf of the Government, for the situation in the ACT's apartment construction industry.

""Is the Government partly responsible? The answer is yes,"" he said.

Mr Parton said if he were building quality minister, he would be willing to accept that responsibility himself.

""If I was in government, I believe I would,"" he said.

""There has been a lack of compliance.""

2021-10-28,ABC,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-19/building-report-author-says-she-wouldnt-buy-new-apartment/11421268,2019-08-18,Building expert commissioned to investigate industry warns 'I wouldn't buy a new apartment' - ABC News,"The co-author of a landmark report on how to fix Australia's building industry has declared she would not buy a newly built apartment, given the scale of the problems.

""If I was going to be investing in an apartment, I'd buy an older one. It's common sense, isn't it? It's just logical,"" Bronwyn Weir told a Four Corners investigation into Australia's building industry.

""I wouldn't buy a newly built apartment. No.""

Ms Weir and former senior public servant Peter Shergold co-wrote the Building Confidence report commissioned by Australia's federal, state and territory building ministers.

The report, delivered in February last year, made 24 recommendations including a crackdown on private certification of buildings and registration of every person involved in the building process.

At a meeting in July, building ministers committed to implementing the reforms, but Ms Weir told Four Corners that would not fix the legacy of decades of inaction.

""The existing building stock is what it is. We have hundreds of thousands of apartments that have been built across the country over the last two, three decades,"" she said. 

""Probably the prevalence of noncompliance has been particularly bad, I would say in the last say 15 to 20 years. It's gotten worse over that period. And that means there's a lot of existing building stock that has defects in it.

""[The new reforms] won't improve existing building stock unfortunately. So there'll be legacy issues for some time and I suspect there'll be legacy issues that we're not even fully aware of yet.""

Ms Weir said for those looking to buy an apartment, it was more prudent to opt for a building ""that maybe is, say, five years plus [of age]"".

""You would like to think that if there are major issues with that building, they'll have started to show,"" she said.

""So I think if people are looking at investing, there are ways to do good due diligence. Buying off the plan is a really tricky proposition at the moment.""

Ms Weir said high-profile cases such as the evacuation of Opal Tower and Mascot towers in Sydney meant ""there is a lack of confidence"" in the building industry.

But she hoped some better builders would give people assurances it was safe to buy ""and try to salvage what has been a pretty damaging impact of these latest news stories"".

A recent study of apartment building defects in Australia by Deakin University and Griffith University found 97 per cent of buildings examined in NSW had at least one defect in multiple areas. In Victoria the figure was 74 per cent and in Queensland it was 71 per cent.

One of the study's authors, Deakin University's Nicole Johnston, told Four Corners previous calls for reform had gone largely unheeded.

""People have been jumping up and down about this for years and years and years,"" Dr Johnston said. 

""There's been lots of committees formed, there's been lots of task forces, there's been lots of consideration around these, but really nothing has happened"".

One glaring example of inaction is how NSW failed to implement laws that could have addressed a major underlying reason for defective building work: dangerous or inferior products.

In 2017, Queensland introduced new laws to police dangerous building products — also called non-conforming products — including flammable cladding that was responsible for the fire spreading in the UK's Grenfell Tower, in an incident which killed 72 people.

The laws — known as chain of responsibility laws — ensure every person who uses or supplies a product on a building can be held personally responsible if it fails.

Later that year, NSW showed a draft bill of its own proposed law to a meeting of building industry groups.

""What we saw was a draft bill that was the Queensland legislation but on steroids — it was better,"" Rodger Hills, the executive officer at the Building Products Industry Council, said.

""They had taken a lot of time to incorporate all the learnings and findings from the Queensland experience and wrapped it up into a piece of legislation that was robust, it was easy to use, and it would have done its job. 

""The industry representative left that meeting very hopeful that this was something that was going to be useful and it actually worked properly.""

When the bill entered the NSW Parliament, Mr Hills said the industry was shocked to see it had been ""absolutely gutted.""

""We counted up about 80 clauses that had been pulled out of the documentation,"" he said.

""Those clauses were all around non-conforming building products. In fact, the definition of a non-conforming building product wasn't even in the bill. 

""All of the clauses to do with chain of responsibility and duty of care, they were all taken out. As were all powers, the recall powers the minister had to recall defective products.""

Four Corners has confirmed the NSW Cabinet rejected the proposed chain of responsibility law due to concerns it would impose more red tape on the building industry, potentially slowing it down.

The NSW Minister for Innovation Kevin Anderson would not comment on Cabinet deliberations but said: ""The NSW Government is currently implementing the largest reform to the building and construction industry in the history of the state.""

""As part of those reforms, the Government is considering a raft of measures that will improve the transparency, accountability and quality of work within the sector,"" he said.

Mr Anderson said the current situation ""is a collective making of industry and the need for more modernised legislation"".

The property industry disputes that there is a crisis, but is backing calls for state governments to implement the recommendations of the Shergold-Weir report.

The chief executive of the Property Council of Australia, Ken Morrison, told Four Corners ""the overwhelming majority of people in the industry are doing the right thing and, in fact, there's great projects right across our cities"".

""I think that statistic [on building defects] points to the fact that when you're doing something very complicated like building a high-rise apartment building, there are going to be things which need to get fixed up,"" he said.

Asked if he would buy a new apartment, Mr Morrison replied: ""I would, absolutely. I think I would be a discerning buyer looking for quality, but absolutely I would.""

In a move one resident described as ""devastating"", the ABC can reveal owners will vote on a $10 million ""special levy"" to fund ""stage one"" of the remedial works for the 132-unit block in a meeting later this month.

The Mascot Towers complex in Sydney's south was evacuated in June after engineers spotted cracking in the primary support structure.

It came six months after Opal Tower in Sydney's west was evacuated on Christmas Eve for similar structural problems.

In the minutes of an owners meeting to be held on August 22, owners will be forced to vote on the $10 million levy to fund the works, with the money paid in quarterly instalments over 15 years.

In June Mascot Towers owners voted to raise $1 million for initial works through a similar special levy.

But since that meeting the price tag for the building, which is too old to fall under warranty, appears to have jumped significantly. 

Mascot Towers apartment owner Fabiano Dos Santos and his girlfriend Tamiris Coutinho learnt of the funding proposal last night.

He said he was ""shocked"" to find out the new numbers and did not know where he would find the cash.

""Before last night we had this sort of number of $5 million to fix the whole situation so now we're seeing numbers between $10 million and $20 million, [so] we're very confused."" 

""The numbers are just skyrocketing. 

""[It means] we'll probably pay $100,000 per owner, just for this first stage thing.""

The Mascot Towers residents' situation has raised questions over liability and exacerbated the ""crisis of confidence"" in the NSW building industry.

This week the ABC revealed residents of Opal Tower have tabled a class action suit in the NSW Supreme Court against the State Government, while Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Thursday announced a new NSW Building Commissioner to drive ""critical reforms"".

The State Government has come under fire for failing to properly regulate the industry, with concerns the problems seen in Mascot Towers and Opal Tower are widespread across the city.

Real Estate agent John Higgins represents 12 owners in the Mascot Towers building.

He said his clients were ""devastated"" with the proposed figure.

""This is a big building and it needs a lot of work to be done,"" he said. ""The levy [will be] a lot of money over the next twenty years.

""I know one of my owners said anything over $40,000 they can't afford and they've been to the banks and the banks won't lend them the money.""

At the August 22 meeting, residents will debate a proposal to engage lawyers and a barrister.

The residents will also vote to initiate legal proceedings in the NSW Supreme Court to seek an access order to the neighbouring property, 27 Church Avenue, to investigate ""damage to common property"".

Under NSW law, building defects are covered under warranty for six years after completion of a development, with experts predicting residents will struggle to find someone to sue.

Like all the residents of the 10-year-old building, Mr Dos Santos and his girlfriend were forced to find a new home after being evacuated in June.

The NSW Government has offered three months of rental assistance, but that is due to run out months before the Mascot Towers is expected to be safe to occupy.

Mr Dos Santos said he was worried.

""This is one of the first times in my life that I don't know what to do.""

NSW police are appealing to the public to help find a prisoner who escaped while taking part in a community project in the Illawarra.

Sunjay Dayal, 35, was serving a 15-month sentence for assault at the Illawarra Reintegration Centre in Unanderra — a low-risk facility.

Dayal was undertaking grounds maintenance work at the Mount Keira Scout Camp in Wollongong when he disappeared between 10:30am and the midday role call.

He was described as being of Indian appearance, 170 centimetres tall and of thin build with black hair and brown eyes.

Smoke from three cars that were set alight in a garage sparked the evacuation of 150 people from their homes in Sydney's south-west this morning

Firefighters were called out to Browne Parade in Liverpool about 3:15am after fire alarms in a unit block and surrounding homes were triggered.

Firefighters rushed on scene to contain the blaze and residents were allowed to return shortly afterward.

NSW police are investigating.

The building industry is hoping the state and federal building ministers' forum in Sydney will lead to tangible reforms for safety and compliance standards.

Major building defects, like those at Sydney's Opal Tower, have caused insurance for building professionals to skyrocket or be withdrawn completely.

Attendees at today's Building Ministers Forum were warned by the Property Council of Australia that a national action plan was needed to address a deepening crisis.

The question of whether the Commonwealth or state governments should pay to remove dangerous combustible cladding from building was also on the agenda.

The number of Australians who own their homes outright has fallen by a third in 24 years as renting continues to rise, new data has found.

Just 29 per cent of people owned their home outright in 2018, down from 43 per cent in 1995, according to the latest housing report by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

The number of people who own with a mortgage has increased to 37 per cent from 28 per cent.

In the same amount of time, rental numbers have rocketed from 19 per cent to 32 per cent.

The NSW Government is pledging $2 million to start a future drought fund for farmers, with Deputy Premier John Barilaro to make the announcement in Dubbo today.

The new emergency fund for graziers will be accessible for farmers during dry spells to cover their income losses.

Agriculture Minister Adam Marshall said he wanted federal and other state governments to contribute so the program could be rolled out for farmers across the country.

""This scheme can help the farming sector stand even stronger on its own two feet,"" he said.

It has been revealed that another apartment tower in Sydney had to be evacuated due to building defects and has now been empty for eight months.

Sydney City Council said it became aware earlier this year that a building in Zetland in the inner east was evacuated by its owners in late 2018, due to extensive water damage and subsequent faults with the fire alarm system.

The NSW Opposition said the revelation showed there was a systemic problem with the building system.

In December last year the Opal Tower in Sydney's west cracked and had to be evacuated, and Mascot Towers in the inner south remains empty after its evacuation in June also due to cracking.

Transport Minister Andrew Constance has predicted Sydney commuters could soon walk straight through ticket barriers without scanning their Opal cards, with future plans for a facial recognition tool.

Mr Constance made the comments during a speech at the Sydney Institute last night.

A spokeswoman for Mr Constance said there was no time frame on introducing the technology and it would be opt-in only, with commuters needing to ask for it. 

Parents have been urged to monitor their children's online activity after four men were charged in the past three weeks for allegedly inciting children for sex.

Police conducted a covert operation in which they spoke with men online and pretended to either be children or their parents.

Four men, aged between 32 and 61, allegedly engaged in conversations about sexually explicit acts they wished to perform on a child, and two allegedly made arrangements to meet for sex.

""With children currently on school holidays, it's a timely reminder to keep an eye on how much time your child is spending on the internet, what websites they are visiting, and who they may be speaking with,"" said Child Abuse and Sex Crimes Squad Commander Detective Superintendent John Kerlatec.

NSW Health has issued its second measles alert in a number of days following the infection of a young Sydney man who recently returned from travel to South East Asia.

The man spent time in Hornsby, Lane Cove, Lindfield, Sydney CBD, Newtown and Erskineville, and also travelled on public transport between June 30 and July 8.

""Symptoms to watch out for include fever, sore eyes and a cough followed three or four days later by a red, blotchy rash that spreads from the head to the rest of the body,"" NSW Health director of communicable diseases Vicky Sheppeard said.

None of the locations visited by the man posed an ongoing risk, she said.

On Saturday, NSW Health issued a measles warning after a man aged in his 40s was diagnosed with the infection after a four-day trip to Sydney.

More than 450 so-called rough sleepers across Sydney have been found housing in the past two years, according to new figures provided by the State Government.

Around 92 per cent of those people have managed to sustain their tenancies after being provided with appropriate support services.

The Minister for Families, Communities and Disability Services, Gareth Ward, said there was a long way to go in reaching the Government's targets in tackling homelessness.

""If you're homeless it's hard to get Centrelink or a Medicare card because you don’t have a mailing or postal address. It's very hard to get a drivers licence, which makes it hard to get work because you don't have the money to sit the tests or get the support to learn the ropes. People who confront homelessness confront a variety of issues.""

Working parents and carers are being asked to contribute to a survey about how workplaces could provide more help to balance work and caring for family.

The National Working Families Survey is a collaboration between corporate Australia and parenting education providers Parents At Work and Karitane.

""The struggle of the juggle is very real. Parenting can be stressful and with the added pressures of working it can have a profound impact on the individual as a parent and also as an employee,"" Karitane CEO Grainne O'Loughlin said.

Researchers from two Australian universities have also helped design the survey to cover issues like parental leave support, flexible work needs and child care.

Six days after the 10-storey high rise was evacuated, it remains partly off limits due to the cracks that appeared in the building's beams on Friday night.

Distressed tenants of the apartment block are being told to go to the Salvation Army if they are facing financial hardship.

The ABC understands at least one couple that own an apartment in Mascot Towers will have to declare bankruptcy if, as expected, costs associated with the cracks run into the millions.

""There is a crisis of confidence developing,"" Karl Sullivan from the Insurance Council of Australia said.

""The insurance industry is continuing to express its concern. Certainly for some time now, we've had concerns over all the risk controls that are available in the building industry and how some of those are executed.""

That is a sentiment echoed by Federal Industry Minister Karen Andrews, who is calling for consistent certification standards.

""We need to look at consistent processes for determining who is going to be qualified to certify those buildings,"" she said.

""It's patchy, it's not good enough and it doesn't lead to any confidence whatsoever in the building sector.""

Less than six months ago, 3,000 residents of the Opal Tower in Sydney Olympic Park had a snap evacuation after fears arose the whole building would collapse.

A report on the incident found parts of the tower were constructed using ""lower-strength concrete"" and ""under-designed"" critical support beams had burst under extreme pressure.

The ABC has been told engineers still do not know what the root cause of the problem at Mascot Towers is — but possibilities include groundwater and excavation work being done on the block next door.

Engineers are continuing to monitor the apartment block and will report back to residents and owners on Thursday night, a spokesman for Minister for Better Regulation Kevin Anderson said.

Litigation by the building's owners' corporation about a building defect identified before Friday night's evacuation had been ongoing for some time, the Minister's spokesman confirmed.

But the Minister said he was very concerned that tenants had no information about that legal action.

For resident Fabiano Dos Santos, there is very little sign of help forthcoming — but he was allowed back home briefly on Tuesday after four days of being without even a wallet.

""I got a couple of minutes — just a couple of minutes to grab my stuff — to get my medicine, my wallet so we can go shopping. So at least things were made a little bit better now,"" he said.

""It is very frustrating to see the politicians on TV saying they're giving all the support they can and all the residents are being supported — that's not happening.""

Tenants are entitled to a waiver or reduction in rent until they can occupy the building under Department of Fair Trading regulations.

If the real estate agent or property owner refuse the request, tenants should notify Fair Trading, and an officer would help them negotiate, the Minister's spokesman said.

Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the Government hoped legislation overhauling the building industry would be introduced in the next session of Parliament.

Lucky not because I managed to break into the apartment market, but because I survived it financially intact.

In 2008 I purchased a two-bedroom apartment in a six-level complex near a good rail service not too far from the Sydney CBD. The development had won environmental awards, it shared a site with local council facilities, and was almost six years old. The building inspection report produced no major issues. 

What could go wrong? 

Within two years we were in full pursuit of a home owner warranty insurance claim to fund about $3 million worth of defect repairs. The external render was falling off, and balconies and bathrooms were leaking into apartments. The builder and developer had evaporated, leaving the insurer as the last resort. 

The claim was robustly defended by the insurance company and failure would see apartment owners liable, on average, for around $50,000 each. Fortunately, by late 2014 we had agreed on a settlement. The long, disruptive repairs process was eventually completed in late 2016 and in mid-2017 we sold out.

I can't ""name names"" because of the settlement. And this is part of the problem.

All too often, legal action against a builder, developer or insurer ends with a settlement which involves a non-disclosure agreement. 

These secret settlements prevent new buyers from learning about a dodgy developer's history.

Plus, what apartment owner is going to go public and undermine the value of the building they part own?

The predicament facing Opal Tower and Mascot Towers apartment owners is only the visible tip of a very big iceberg. 

So my advice to my kids today, and anyone who'll listen, is this: do not buy a new apartment, especially if it is over three stories high.

Think about older, simpler, three-level walk-up options.

In most states, home warranty insurance cover is no longer required (or even available) for new apartments over three levels.

Alternatives vary by state, but in NSW, there is instead a 2 per cent bond scheme to cover defects identified in the first two years of a new building. There are also statutory warranties provided by the builder for all defects identified in the first two years, and ""major"" defects found within the first six years.

With no access to the home warranty insurance I had, an apartment owner today faced with the problems I faced in 2008 would have to find the $50,000 to fix the building defects. 

The situation facing many others is worse still. In addition to situations like Opal Towers where residents have seen the value of their apartments collapse, flammable cladding rectification is costing some apartment owners closer to $100,000 to repair.

My second piece of advice is to inspect the whole building, not just the apartment you're interested in.

Worn carpets, flaky paint, water stains and cracks are tell-tale signs of poor management. Talk to residents, particularly renters who don't have a stake in protecting the value of the building. Expert help is good but choose your help wisely.

Always inspect the strata records very carefully before committing to a purchase contract. If there is more than token resistance to this then walk away. 

Those records should include all expert reports prepared for the strata scheme since its inception, including the initial defect inspection reports, all the financial data and the minutes of the required general meetings and strata committee meetings. 

Reviewing this with the assistance of an experienced eye can tell you a lot about the building. Spending on preventative maintenance is good. A solid set of provisions on the capital fund to cover future repairs and asset replacements is good too.

This mess has been with us now for many years as ever bigger apartment buildings have been pumped out to meet demand in rapidly growing cities. Quantity has trumped quality and the needs of the consumer.

The poor companies are low-cost, low-standard outfits. The good companies have to compete with this and it tends to be a race to the bottom. As one builder told me candidly, ""if they buy rubbish, we will build rubbish"". 

The problem is, the apartment buyer has almost no way of knowing whether or not they are buying from a gold star company or dodgy brothers. 

Governments appear to have been looking the other way, too. Review after review has raised issues with the regulation of the industry. 

In NSW, the recommendations of the Lambert Review completed in late 2015 have been largely left on the shelf. 

It took 12 months, the Opal Tower fiasco and a state election to get action in response to the Shergold and Weir Report prepared for the building ministers nationally. 

Despite a set of commitments by the NSW Government to act on this before the March state election, almost 100 days have passed since without any draft legislation coming forward. 

And this is far from a problem for NSW only.

Confidence in new apartment offerings has been shattered at the very time that builders and developers are facing a downturn. While I feel for the good companies, and I am sure there are some, the industry's neglect of the end consumer will probably hurt them all.

The failure of apartment living to work is a disaster for the wider community too. How do we meet the housing needs of the future if people shy away from apartment living? What are the economic consequences of a collapse in the demand for new apartments? 

Effective public policy initiatives, including effective consumer protection for apartment owners, are economic imperatives.

In the meantime, if you are tempted to buy a new apartment over three levels, don't.

Residents were forced to evacuate the 10-storey Sydney building on Friday night after major cracks appeared in its beams.

Temporary building props were installed in the carpark earlier in the week due to the ""rapid deterioration"" of cracks within a primary support beam, residents were told.

Under NSW law, building defects are covered under warranty for six years after completion of a development.

Stephen Goddard, spokesman for the Owners Corporation Network — an advocacy group for owners in strata schemes — said owners of apartments in the decade-old Mascot Towers development were no longer covered by the statutory warranty period and would now be left with a hefty bill.

""Consumers have nowhere to go in these sorts of situations, there's nobody for them to sue, there's nowhere for them to turn,"" Mr Goddard said.

""People have more consumer protection buying a fridge than a million-dollar apartment.""

The owners corporation would now pay for the cost of repairs to the building by raising strata levies, he said.

Mr Goddard said 80 per cent of all new apartment buildings were constructed with structural defects, many of which do not appear until the six-year warranty has passed.

""Anybody looking to purchase in a building less than 10 years of age is foolish because the defects will not have yet surfaced,"" he said.

""Don't buy anything less than 10 years old. You never buy off the plan, it's unsafe to do so,"" he said, adding that buyers should not assume any modern apartment building had been built to code.

Mr Goddard, who is also a strata lawyer, said the High Court had recently confirmed that developers and builders do not owe owners' corporations any duty of care because owners' corporations do not exist at the time of registration of the plan.

He called on the NSW Parliament to create a statutory duty of care to better protect consumers and said, so far, there had been no political incentive for governments to do so.

""Most of our parliaments are on a sort of junkie hit when it comes to the building industry,"" he said.

""The more they help the builder build, the more stamp duty they get, the more council and water rates come in.

The structural problems in Mascot come six months after 3,000 residents of the Opal Tower at Olympic Park were evacuated from the building after major movement was detected.

Mr Goddard said the implications for owners in these buildings could be ongoing.

""The building will become toxic, just like Opal, where you won't be able to sell out of it because people know of the structural defects,"" he said.

""For many years, ever-increasing property prices have 'wallpapered' over the issue.

""We're now seeing owners confronted with the possibility that their investment … may be lower than their outstanding mortgage.""

MGM Properties principal real estate agent Michael Xylas has a one-bedroom apartment in Mascot Towers on the market for $740,000 which he said was now unlikely to sell. 

""Obviously, I don't think anybody will be in a position to commit to buying a property with a building that's got problems,"" Mr Xylas said. 

""It's very damaging for the vendor who was counting on selling this property.""

Mr Xylas said gaps in the strata system meant there should be annual checks by certifiers to ensure buildings' structural integrity.

""I think there will be a lot more scrutiny on the construction side of buildings now, so building inspectors will be doing thorough checks on buildings prior to making any recommendations,"" he said. 

""There's a number of buildings that I know that there's been no checks and only when something does happen that all of a sudden they start getting engineers to do reports on buildings. 

""So, I think as part of any strata now there should be an introduction to make sure that there's a certifier or an engineers' report done on an annual basis.""

Apartment expert and columnist Jimmy Thomson said many new buildings seemed to be constructed to lower standards as builders and developers attempt to cut costs.

""We all know that every new apartment block in Sydney has problems of some sort — most of which can be fixed,"" he said.

Common problems included water leakage and lack of fire protection, Mr Thomson said.

Major structural defects were much less common, but it was hard to put a figure on it, especially when they happen outside the statutory warranty period.

""It's very hard to find out how many there are because the last thing that owners in a building want to do is publicise the fact that they own apartments in a defective building,"" he said.

Mr Thomson said prospective apartment buyers need to do their due diligence to make sure the developer is reputable before buying.

And for those who own in buildings that are less than six years old, ensure the entire development has been thoroughly inspected for defects.

Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the Department of Fair Trading would investigate the cause of the structural damage at Mascot Towers and the Government would do everything in its power to hold whoever was responsible to account. 

Ms Berejiklian conceded more needed to be done to protect consumers, given the large number of people living in strata developments.

""We're doing everything we can to support all residents in these circumstances and more importantly trying to get on the front foot to ensure that these type of situations don't arise in the future,"" she said.

2021-10-28,ABC,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-02-14/elara-apartment-owners-lose-federal-court-compensation-bid/10810628,2019-02-14,Elara apartment owners lose Federal Court compensation bid - ABC News,"A group of Canberra apartment owners facing $19 million in repairs for shoddy building work has been dealt another blow, losing a Federal Court bid to claim compensation.

The Elara Apartment complex, built in 2007 on a prime block of land in Bruce, has been haunted by a web of problems with the development and failed legal action.

Last year, the ABC revealed the plight of Elara apartment owners, who said the apartments were beset with leaks and other problems and tried to sue Canberra builder B&T Constructions. They subsequently went into voluntary administration.

The group then lodged claims with the Master Builders Fidelity Fund, which was set up in 2002 to compensate those who could not sue their builder.

Compensation was capped at $85,000 per owner, but claims had to be made within five years from May 25, 2007. The first claim to the fund was not lodged until August 18, 2017.

The fund rejected the applications because they were lodged outside the five-year deadline, a decision upheld by the Federal Court yesterday.

The apartment owners alleged the work performed by the builder ""was not carried out in a proper and skilful way and with good and proper materials"".

""Consequently, defects exist in the common property, load-bearing walls, balconies and utility services.

""The cost of rectifying the defects is estimated at more than $19 million, which is only slightly less than the cost of the initial project.""

But Justice John Griffiths rejected the claims because they ""did not arise within time period"".

""In my view, there is no obligation on the trustees of the fund to pay an amount to the applicant even where a valid request or claim has been made,"" Justice Griffiths said.

""The trustees have a discretion in the matter, not only as to whether to pay any amount at all, but also as to the actual amount which might be paid, subject to the relevant cap.""

Justice Griffiths stated ""the claims themselves were not submitted within the time period, set out in the relevant legislations; or within the currency of any of the fidelity certificates for Elara.

""The fidelity certificates are not an independent or isolated source of enforceable legal rights and obligations.

He said the period of cover under the Fidelity Fund Scheme expired on May 26, 2012, being one day after the five-year period following the issue of a certificate of occupancy for each unit.

""In the particular circumstances here, the builder did not become insolvent until 20 July 2017, which is well outside the period of covers,"" he said. 

""It matters not that the loss referred to ... crystallised within the period of cover. This has no relevance unless the condition specified ... also crystallises within that time.""

The second claim, which was submitted even later than the first claim, was rejected on the same basis.

The owners were also ordered to ""pay the respondent's costs, as agreed or assessed"".

David Allen, who bought an apartment in 2012, told the ABC last year that problems within the complex began to arise immediately.

""We were looking at a place for my daughter to stay and [it] was perfect, just across the road from the University of Canberra,"" he said.

Less than a month after buying the unit, problems started to mount.

""Water penetration was occurring within the unit, the balcony floor was leaking, [there were] floods in the carpark,"" he said.

""We'd bought a lemon. How foolish were we?""

A second man, who the ABC called John, also noticed red flags and reported the problems to the property manager.

""A lot of the earlier signs were that 'yes, we'll get onto this straight away, we'll come and fix this',"" John said.

""But things did seem to [drag] on for quite some time, a lot longer than they really should.""

Eventually the owners commissioned an expert report into the building's defects. It found highly corrosive water leaking onto car paintwork through the basement, and warned of serious structural and fire safety risks.

It also alleged some balconies were at risk of collapse — a claim the ACT Government took so seriously it ordered B&T Constructions to install propping to support the structure.

The company initially complied but removed some a few months later without approval, citing their own report claiming the risk was exaggerated.

In the meantime other problems festered, according to waterproofing expert Ross Taylor.

""The scale and the complexity of the issues at Elara are amongst the worst that I've come across in my 40 years,"" Mr Taylor said.

""There's about 12 categories of issues … roofs, walls, bathroom leaking, balcony leaking, basement leaks and structural issues.""

Owners would find themselves battling against rapidly moulding walls and cracked ceilings.

An initial estimate put the repair cost above $19 million, though the owners say that number continues to rise.

A crack was found in a pre-cast concrete panel inside the building on Christmas Eve, which prompted an emergency evacuation over fears the 34-storey building could have been structurally unsafe.

Some residents were allowed back into their homes, but were again ordered to get out on Thursday afternoon so a ""comprehensive investigation"" into the incident could take place.

The State Government has also launched its own investigation into the crack, appointing two university professors of engineering to write a report which will be made public.

But the Berejiklian Government has been under pressure to act further to allay fears about other buildings which have shot up in Sydney in recent years and Minister for Better Regulation, Matt Kean, today revealed its next steps.

""If you're a certifier who's done the wrong thing, I will find you and I will throw the book at you,"" he told the ABC.

""I will rub you out of the industry if you're found to be doing the wrong thing.""

The Government's four new measures include a large compliance operation which will see 25 to 30 per cent of certification work audited every year, undertaken in a ""strike force-style approach"".

""We're looking at buildings that are currently being constructed, and buildings that have gone up in recent times,"" Mr Kean said.

Under a new disciplinary policy, any certifiers found to be corrupt or to have negligently signed off on a building which is unsafe or structurally unsound will be immediately kicked out of the industry.

Certifiers who are found to have breached the industry's code of conduct on building quality will be banned from working on new strata developments for 12 months.

More information will also be available to home owners and buyers about a certifier's disciplinary record and work history.

Mr Kean said the crackdown has not been launched because he is concerned about the way the Opal Tower was certified.

""There's an investigation going on, I want to wait until we get the results of that investigation, but what it has highlighted is further community concerns about certification in NSW,"" he said.

Mr Kean also hinted more changes to the building industry may be on the way.

""Certification is one piece of the puzzle here, but there are many other parts of the building industry where we need to shine a light on what's been going on,"" he said.

""I want to make sure we do whatever is possible to give the public confidence that the buildings that they are living in across Sydney are safe.""

The NSW Opposition promised to introduce a single piece of legislation to strengthen building regulations.

Leader Michael Daley said he would also set up a single agency to streamline accountability.

""Labor's reforms are designed to protect the home buyer from some of the unscrupulous practices that have been allowed to take root and grow in the industry,"" Mr Daley said.

If the Opposition wins next year's election, Mr Daley will also prevent developers from choosing their own certifier.

Independent Sydney MP Alex Greenwich has called for a special commission of inquiry into apartment building defects to be set up.

The Opal Building's developer, ECove, insists the building is structurally sound.

The investigation into the incident is expected to take at least another five days and residents are currently being put up in hotels around Sydney — and compensated — while they are required to be out of the building.

As most residents of Opal Tower were last night escorted from their homes to enable a ""comprehensive investigation"" into the crack in a concrete panel that forced them out, calls for more stringent checks and balances into the apartment development industry are growing louder.              

NSW Labor today called for the investigation into Opal Tower — currently being carried out by two experienced independent engineers — to include the planning approvals process.  

It came as Alex Greenwich, the independent Member for Sydney, called for a special commission of inquiry into apartment building defects.

""The State Government needs to understand that there are potential ramifications across the entire sector for all new high-rise development,"" Labor shadow minister for planning Tania Mihailuk said on Saturday.

""Public confidence needs to be repaired promptly. 

""There are so many new high-rise developments that have been approved and residents need peace of mind."" 

Current approvals suggest the number of apartments at Sydney Olympic Park — the site where Opal Tower sits — will increase from 6000 to 10,700, with the number of residents in the area jumping from 14,000 to 23,500. 

A spokesman for NSW Minister for Planning Anthony Roberts said they would address the issue later today. 

Sitting on ""state significant"" land, Opal Tower was given the green light by former NSW planning minister Rob Stokes. 

Concerns have been raised by independent bodies over the ability for developers to employ private certifiers, meaning developers could potentially get their own certifiers to give the green light to multi-million dollar developments. 

Building Designers Association of Australia president Chris Knierim said over the past three years he had seen construction standards decrease to ""below what I would consider a pass"".   

""This (the Opal Tower crack) is not an isolated incident,"" he said. 

""The concern is that during the construction boom we can't cope with the level of construction that is going on. 

""Corners are being cut. 

""And what we're seeing is it's rushed because of the dollar, people need to make money and we have a tick and flick mentality. Builders are dropping their margins just to make money … it's shocking."" 

Urban Taskforce chief executive Chris Johnson said the ""ripple effect"" of the Opal Tower incident would be ""enormous"". 

""It's unheard of,"" he said. 

""I've never seen this before. 

""But there are multiple levels here [at Opal Tower] and where the error has occurred in the chain of command [between the developer, builder, pre-fabricator and engineers] will have to be assessed through the forensic investigation.""  

Mr Johnson said the NSW Government should look at a ""centre of excellence"" for planning decisions currently handed to councils that are out of their depth.     

""We maybe need to bring more expertise — the best quality minds — into this process to ensure it doesn't happen again,"" he said. 

""For bigger scale projects, above $20 million or so, should go to a centre of excellence shared by the councils [where these bigger scale projects are occurring].""   

Engineers are today scouring through the Opal Tower building to discover the source of the crack, with reports suggesting 16 prefabricated concrete panels used in the garden slots are being looked at.

Opal Tower builder, Icon, said it expected the investigation to take as long as 10 days. 

However it could not guarantee whether a longer time frame would be required. Today is first official day of its investigation. 

The ABC understands a small number of residents in the Opal Tower building are still inside because of mobility issues.

An ABC investigation revealed an estimated $20 million repair bill for a string of defects at the Elara Apartments in Bruce, which left apartment owners calling for a strengthening of the building regulatory system.

The complex was completed in 2007, but its executive committee chairman, David Allen, said little had been achieved in the intervening decade.

""We've tried to engage as many people in the process as we can, directly through the negotiation process [and] the regulator,"" he said.

""We've tried to engage various consultants to no real end.""

At one point the ACT Government issued an emergency order on the property's builder to fix some pressing issues, and later started the process of handing down a broader order for rectification work.

But with the builder now in liquidation, Mr Allen said the Government's efforts amounted to too little, too late.

""There is little will for them to do the things that they actually can do, that they actually have the power to do,"" he said.

""It's been really difficult to get someone to say 'I'll stand up, I'll take responsibility and I'll do something for you'.""

On Thursday, Regulatory Services Minister Gordon Ramsay said he wanted to ensure the ACT's system was up to scratch, and promised the Government would ""continue to listen and continue to act"".

Mr Ramsay said he had asked Government agency Access Canberra to assess the situation.

""To see what gaps there might be, whether they are legislative gaps or regulatory gaps and if there are any, to provide advice to myself and to [Planning Minister] Mick Gentleman so we can continue to act on it,"" he said.

""We have been increasing the regulatory tools that we have over the recent years, but we're looking to see whether we still have the best suite of tools available.

""This Government takes very seriously the work that is needed to make sure that building in the ACT is of the highest quality.""

Waterproofing expert Ross Taylor, who has worked with the Elara owners' corporation, said Canberra was especially bad for defective construction.

""The building defects in Canberra high-rise construction are perhaps the worst in Australia,"" he said.

""There are elements of exceptionally good construction and design, but ... the average apartment building in Canberra leaks within the first few years.""

But Mr Taylor said too much of the blame was often laid at the feet of builders.

""They seem to be in the front line for this, and some might say they're the soft starting target because they're the most visible,"" he said.

""We find about 80 per cent of defects lie in design ... and we see that one of the primary influencers of design is the original developer.""

The privatisation of building certifiers, who sign off on a complex's compliance with codes and regulation, was a particularly pressing issue according to Mr Taylor.

""It's akin to the highway patrol being outsourced and all the highway patrolman are sacked, and private patrollers come in,"" he said.

""They don't actually go into the field and measure speed, what they do is ... everybody sends in a form that says 'I haven't sped this month'.""

The ACT Construction Occupations Registrar, Craig Simmons, conceded the process with Elara had not been ideal.

""It could have been better handled in terms of what we know now, but having gone through the process ... we've made changes in the way we approach these sort of matters,"" he said.

""I don't think we would go down the same process or take as long if it was to happen today.""

One key change has been to licensing, with a post-qualification exam for prospective builders seeking accreditation.

""There is a gap between what is being taught and learned in those courses and what we as a regulator expect,"" Mr Simmons said.

Mr Simmons also pushed back on concerns about private building certifiers, arguing the system allows more professionals to service a growing market.

""In any given market there will be people who are very, very good at their job and people who are not very good at their job,"" he said.

""Once we find those people who aren't doing the right thing, we take action against them. We don't need those kind of people in our industry.""

But after six years of negotiation and legal drama, that is exactly the problem faced by David Allen, who bought into Canberra's Elara Apartments in 2012.

""We were looking at a place for my daughter to stay and [it] was perfect, just across the road from the University of Canberra,"" he said.

That dream did not last long. Less than a month after buying the unit, problems started to mount.

""Water penetration was occurring within the unit, the balcony floor was leaking, [there were] floods in the car park,"" he said.

""We'd bought a lemon. How foolish were we?""

It turns out those problems were just the tip of the iceberg: Mr Allen would eventually find himself leading a group of owners chasing down a defects bill totalling $20 million.

But their story is just part of a web of problem development, failed legal action and apparently toothless regulation, all centred around Canberra-based B&T Constructions and its director Ivan Bulum.

The Elara Apartments were built in 2007, on a prime block of land in the north Canberra suburb of Bruce.

Its nearby lakes, schools and hospital were clear drawcards for one off-the-plan purchaser, who the ABC will call John.

""I thought, perfect investment … close to the pond, the business park area … I couldn't go past [it],"" he said.

But John, who has a long history in the trades industry, started to notice red flags immediately.

""Down in the basement area, things were incomplete, not finished off,"" he said. 

John reported the problems to the property manager and found the initial response promising.

""A lot of the earlier signs were that yes, we'll get onto this straight away, we'll come and fix this,"" he said.

""But things did seem to [drag] on for quite some time, a lot longer than they really should.""

Eventually the owners took matters into their own hands, commissioning an expert report into the building's defects.

For starters, it found highly corrosive water leaking onto car paintwork through the basement.

""The only avenue to the unit owners at this stage has been to turn the landscape watering off and watch the plants die so that the carpark can at least dry out in between showers,"" the report read.

More urgently, the author warned of serious structural and fire safety risks.

In the event of a fire, he argued first-floor steel columns would fail in less than 30 minutes, rather the 90 minutes required by the Building Code.

The report found similar problems in the basement: ""A fire engulfing these columns in our view runs a serious risk of collapsing the adjacent slab.""

It also alleged some balconies were at risk of collapse — a claim the ACT Government took so seriously it ordered B&T Constructions to install propping to support the structure. 

The company initially complied but removed some a few months later — without approval — citing their own report claiming the risk was exaggerated.

In the meantime other problems festered, according to waterproofing expert Ross Taylor.

""The scale and the complexity of the issues at Elara are amongst the worst that I've come across in my 40 years,"" Mr Taylor said.

""There's about 12 categories of issues … roofs, walls, bathroom leaking, balcony leaking, basement leaks and structural issues.""

Owners would find themselves battling against rapidly moulding walls and cracked ceilings.

The Elara owners' corporation attempted to claim that money through the courts, accusing Mr Bulum's B&T Constructions of multiple breaches of the Buildings Code and other laws.

The litigation sat largely dormant until the owners moved to restart proceedings in mid-2017, relying on a eight expert reports to bolster their case.

But it was all for nothing: The very next day, B&T Constructions moved into voluntary administration, meaning the case was scuttled.

""It [was] like someone just stuck a big pin into a balloon … and all of a sudden you've just got this piece of rubber on the ground,"" Mr Allen said.

""We thought we were getting close on a number of occasions and to have them just go away was really disheartening.""

John agreed: ""I was burnt out, I didn't have any more in me to fight it,"" he said.

To make matters worse, administrators told prospective creditors that any money raised from B&T's liquidation would likely go back to its director, Ivan Bulum, through an associated company that was owed a secured debt of $1.7 million. 

Insurance is now the only recourse left to Elara's owners and would only cover about half the alleged rectification bill.

The decade-long saga has taken a sledgehammer to the reputation of the building: Mr Allen has seen the value of his unit drop $40,000 to $50,000 in five years.

""I should be retired now and living the dream. But this is the dream, which is really a nightmare,"" he said.

Elara is just one defect-riddled complex connected with B&T Constructions or Mr Bulum.

The Empire Apartments in Forrest, described in advertising as ""the epitome of luxury, prestige and convenience"", featured 37 breaches of the Building Code and other legislation.

The builder deviated from approved plans on multiple occasions; swapping out high-quality stone and aluminium cladding with cheaper cement board and rendered paint finish, and not providing glass balustrades as promised for the building's penthouse apartments.

The company appealed against three breaches in the territory's highest court — and lost. 

""The building as constructed is of an inferior standard or quality to that for which [B&T Constructions] had lawful approval,"" the majority of the court found in a 2-1 decision.

Another block in the Weston Creek suburb of Holder was subject to an emergency government order targeting a range of defects, including a broken sewerage pipe. 

""A sewerage leak … was detected with significant effluent discharge seeping through the block wall within the garage adjacent to the main panel lift entry door,"" a report cited in the government order read.

The total repair bill was estimated to be as high as $300,000.

In explaining his decision to issue the order, the Deputy Construction Occupations Registrar said the work would mitigate risks to health, safety and property. 

""I am satisfied that the premises was built in such a way as to pose a risk to building occupants … [and] that rectification work needs to be undertaken immediately,"" he said.

For almost three decades government regulators have been trying to hold Mr Bulum accountable. 

In the early-to-mid-90s, the ACT Government tried three separate times to force one of Mr Bulum's oldest companies — I&M Holdings — into liquidation over unpaid debts totalling more than $150,000.

The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) tried to do the same with another Bulum company, B&T Homes, over $1.4 million in unpaid debt in 2004.

The ATO's territory counterpart tried to liquidate a third Bulum company, 4/49M Pty Ltd, over almost $35,000 in outstanding rates and interest.

Each time, the action was either withdrawn or dismissed.

Much of the Government's efforts against Mr Bulum and his associates have involved the Construction Occupations Registrar, which handles ACT licensing.

With the issues at Empire and Elara seemingly going nowhere, in 2014 the Registrar asked the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal (ACAT) to strip B&T Constructions, Mr Bulum and an associate of their building licences for five years.

ACAT did not cancel any, but did fine B&T Constructions $10,000 and force it to fix problems at Empire or face suspension.

The company did not comply, so its licence was suspended in April 2016.

The Government also tried to reject a building licence application from another Bulum company, Minotaur Constructions, even going so far as to draft and pass legislation allowing it to do so ""to protect the public"".

But the company had that decision set aside by arguing the legislation could not be applied retrospectively.

Mr Bulum was born in Croatia in 1945.

He appeared as a witness at the Trade Union Royal Commission in 2015, telling the hearing he had more than 50 years of experience building in Canberra.

On Wednesday, Mr Bulum directly controls 53 different companies, some with virtually identical names like 19/29 Pty Ltd and 19/29BT Pty Ltd.

Since the demise of B&T Constructions, a new corporate identity — The Bulum Group — has appeared to take the lead, ushering in a major redevelopment of Braddon's Lonsdale Street.

That company is responsible for at least four projects on the formerly industrial street.

Neither The Bulum Group nor any other Bulum company holds a current ACT building licence — instead Mr Bulum has turned from builder to developer, contracting out construction to Canberra-based companies.

The ABC is not alleging the presence of defects in any of these newer properties.

The saga at Elara has raised questions about how the Government handles problem building work.

With B&T Constructions wound up, there appears to be no way for the owners to pursue funds from Mr Bulum and his companies, even as they continue to develop major projects across the city.

The Bulum Group is not captured under so-called anti-phoenixing legislation — which seeks to stop builders shifting companies — because it does not cover developers who do not physically construct their own projects.

Beyond that, Mr Allen said lack of action from the Government worsened the experience.

""It's been really difficult to get someone to say 'I'll stand up, I'll take responsibility and I'll do something for you',"" he said.

""As long as you accept poor performance, you'll get poor performance.""

Mr Bulum did not respond to a series of questions and instead referred the ABC to the liquidators of B&T Constructions.

In Sydney, one resident showed Background Briefing a dam in his living room that he had installed while he waited out a long legal process.

Apartment owners can spend years fighting through the courts to recoup repair costs, only to find out that the developer or builder has gone bankrupt or has been placed into administration.

And while NSW's Fair Trading Commissioner is spruiking legal reforms that will come into effect later this year, lawyers who represent apartment owners say they do not go far enough.

From July 1, a developer or builder in NSW will have to set aside 2 per cent of the construction cost of a project as a bond that can be accessed later by residents if the builder or developer disappears.

Leaks have also been explicitly recognised as a ""major defect"", which attracts a warranty period of six years. However, the bond can only be claimed within two years of a building's completion.

""There are some checks and balances in there that weren't there before. Let's be grateful for small mercies,"" said Suzi Broome, solicitor and consultant with Sachs Gerace Broom.

""But really, 2 per cent? It's diddly squat. It's just insulting when you compare how much money those innocent homeowners have to pay out.""

No-one knows for sure how many apartments are defective or leaky, but some figures indicate most new buildings have some kind of problem.

""Nobody keeps records of this stuff,"" said Bill Randolph, the director of the City Futures Research Centre at the University of New South Wales.

""Quite a lot of the defects don't get anywhere, they don't get to the court, or owners just pay up and get on with it because they can't be bothered to cover the cost of taking a builder to court.""

A survey of strata owners conducted by the Research Centre in 2010 found that a startling 85 per cent of respondents in buildings built since 2000 said their buildings were defective.

Professor Randolph said the respondents were self-selecting, and they may have been more motivated to return the survey if they had problems.

But Ms Broome suggested that figure was close to the mark, saying that if she had to estimate, she would guess around 70 per cent of new buildings leak.

""That's a straw poll,"" she said. ""It may be higher. Sadly I don't think it would be lower.""

Some people who've bought into new buildings in the past are struggling with major building problems.

John, who owns an apartment in Wentworth Point, a development near the Parramatta River, said he had to vacuum 120 litres of rainwater off his floor after a storm.

""I'd stop it, unplug it, take it out and drain it, and bring it back and start again to fill it up,"" John said.

John's apartment complex, called Palermo, was finished in 2007. The owners found fire safety issues with the building soon after they moved in, and later, in 2015, the building sprang some serious leaks.

The leak in John's apartment was so bad, he eventually had a small dam installed in his living room as a stopgap measure. The dam is still there today.

""That dam, about 100 litres would be contained in that. In hindsight, we probably needed to make the dam higher,"" he said.

The temporary measures were necessary while John waited out a long legal process.

The builder of the apartments had collapsed, negotiations with the developer were going nowhere, and the owners had to gather complex technical evidence in preparation for court.

Then, in February this year, almost three years after the owners commenced legal action, the developer, Payce Properties, announced that it was being placed into administration.

The parent company, Payce Consolidated, is still trading, and has plans to roll out more than 7,000 more apartments in the next five years.

In a statement emailed to Background Briefing, the company said: ""The Palermo Owners' Corporation elected to pursue a course of litigation rather than resolution.

""Payce was no longer prepared to waste time in litigation and spend money on lawyers that should instead be spent on building defect rectification.

""As has been the case since it was first advised of defect issues, Payce remains willing and able to address defects.""

Just one suburb over from John's house in Wentworth Point, residents in a large new development called Centenary Park have already discovered leaks, cracks and other building problems.

On a rainy day, Background Briefing witnessed several leaks in apartment buildings that are only three years old.

One couple, Kitty and Kevin, showed a large patch of sodden carpet in their bedroom.

They complained about the leak to the builder, who insisted that the leak was a maintenance issue.

""What can we do? Just keep sending emails,"" said Kevin.

There was a blockage, but also a leak. After Background Briefing visited the complex, the leak was fixed by the developer.

That developer's lawyer said it was ""the result of improper or absent maintenance on the part of the occupant"" and that ""the builder actively responds to all claims, repairing legitimate claims, and providing reasons in cases where the builder determines that the claim is not a defect for which the builder is responsible"".

Concerns over the quality of new apartment buildings is not confined to NSW.

Victoria's Building Authority has labelled waterproofing a ""possible systemic issue"" and announced that it is conducting an inquiry in response to reports about ""leaky building syndrome"".

Phil Dwyer — a veteran builder based in Victoria, and the president of the Builders Collective of Australia, which represents small builders — said he had seen apartments that would make hair stand on end.

""Just imagine the black blotching of of mould about 15 to 1,600 millimetres above the floor, the plaster you can put your finger through, the carpet has actually grown grass on it,"" he said.

""We are of the opinion at that the moment that our industry is in crisis ... there is no doubt that the next 10, 20 years is going to see such a decline in the integrity of the building industry that it won't be funny.""

He said he decided to stop building apartments, because developers did not offer him enough money to do a proper job.

""Up until about September last year we've knocked back 17 apartment buildings,"" he said. ""And that's just one little builder here in Melbourne.""

The tour included the hospital's emergency department, a 16-bed inpatient ward, and provided views of internal courtyards and food and retail areas.

Health Minister Jack Snelling said so-called ""technical completion"" was expected next week, with the opening of the hospital likely in the middle of the year.

Public hospital tours would be held most likely in June, he said.

""When this opens this will be a game changer for health care not only in South Australia but right around the world,"" Mr Snelling said.

""I feel a bit like a proud dad today being able to show off this wonderful new facility to a large group of doctors, nurses and allied health professionals.""

Three health professionals were on today's tour, including Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH) physiotherapist Jess Anaf.

""When you walk around this hospital seeing some of the green spaces, some of the internal courtyards and the natural light, I think that is so important for our patients, to feel like they can see the outside and get some fresh air,"" she said.

""I think that is so valuable for mental health and wellbeing.""

With 800 overnight and day beds and 40 operating theatres and procedural rooms, nurse Kristin Manuel was overwhelmed.

""The size of the hospital it takes your breath away at first,"" Ms Manuel said.

""I think that all South Australians are going to embrace the hospital and they're going, I hope patients are going to want to leave, I think they're going to want to stay.""

Building defects were the subject of legal action late last year, with the Government intending to seek compensation from the building consortium for some flaws.

The hospital will be Australia's most expensive building and reportedly the third most expensive in the world.

It's unclear how much is being sought, but the Government said the arbitration process should be wrapped up by the end of the year.

Premier Jay Weatherill said the problems were in the past.

""I think the wait has been worth it,"" Mr Weatherill said.

""This is the best hospital in Australia and I think as you've seen today it has features which have been designed very much with one purpose in mind that is the patient.""

SA Health Partnership chief executive Duncan Jewell expressed frustration an opening had been delayed and that the State Government and the builders had ended up in court over alleged defects.

""I just don't think it's necessary to have such a protracted legal process when this could be sorted out, I think, reasonably simply, he said.

The new hospital is almost a year behind schedule and costing the builder about $1 million per day in service payments.

Mr Jewell said talk of safety concerns was unwarranted.

""People are saying the hospital is unsafe but in six months' time we're going to want people to move in there,"" he said.

""It is a fantastic building, it's a really complex building, it's been a challenging build but it's something we should all be in South Australia very proud of.""

He expressed confidence the hospital would be finished by mid-March to allow  it to open for patients in June and said he regretted the deadline of last April coming and going without the work being completed.

""Perhaps we didn't handle that the way we should have, in hindsight, but we really do think we've got our act together, we've put forward a credible cure plan,"" he said.

""We're on target, we believe we've got credible dates, we're sharing information and I just don't think there's a need for such extensive levels of court action and litigation,"" Mr Jewell said.

The Supreme Court has heard of alleged building defects, and a site inspection has been made by Justice Malcolm Blue.

Mr Jewell said the Government had been resisting any issues being fixed after technical completion of the build.

""Sure it wasn't built to specification, there'll have to be some compensation paid to the Government, but [those issues] not going to stop it opening,"" he said.

""Everyone's going to fall in love with it when they get in there — the space, the patient rooms, the theatres, the artwork, how it's been designed and flows.""

The partnership involved in the project had six investors and backing of 29 local and international banks, Mr Jewell said, and criticisms had damaged the consortium and South Australia.

""It's just getting a lot of negative publicity. I'm not sure that equates to sovereign risk but, at the same time, I just don't think we as a state need that type of publicity,"" he said.

The building consortium is not allowed to make public statements without Government permission, and it was a requirement before Mr Jewell could speak with the ABC.

A water cooling system broke down during testing last May, flooding two floors, and Health Minister Jack Snelling expressed concern the system could fail again in the future and put patients at risk.

But Mr Jewell said independent experts had rated the system 99.9 per cent reliable.

""The Health Minister does have some concerns in relation to the condensed water system and we're happy to work through those with him,"" Mr Jewell said.

The new hospital at the western end of the city will replace an ageing facility at the eastern end of North Terrace.

The school in the small fishing and holiday town was rebuilt at a cost of about $6 million after the 2013 bushfires.

Now, mould has been found in parts of the buildings, including on some walls, after flooding on two occasions this year.

Dozens of parents and grandparents at Tuesday night's meeting wanted to know why there had been a mould infestation and when the department had become aware of the problem.

Robyn Kim, whose granddaughter goes to the school, pressed Education Department representatives for answers.

""It was mentioned a couple of times about the severe weather causing the damage, can you explain that please,"" Ms Kim said.

""Why would the severe weather cause it if there wasn't anything wrong in the first place?""

Robert Williams from the Education Department said the causes were unknown at this stage.

""They could be building defects, they could be design defects, they could be just the fact that a great big storm came and hit a town and the wind comes through here pretty strongly sometimes,"" he said.

The department has engaged private consultants for advice on how to properly remove the mould and said anything that cannot be cleaned would be thrown out.

Extra staff have been posted to the primary school, the equivalent of four full-time positions, to support staff and students while some classrooms are closed for repairs.

Education Minister Jeremy Rockliff said an independent assessment of all occupation health and safety issues was being conducted.

He said the Government's number one priority was child safety and the future of the school, which is a focal point of the community.

""This school will absolutely be up and running in the not too distant future and will be a happy and vibrant place and a great learning environment for the students,"" the Minister said after the meeting.

Mr Rockliff is confident it will be business as usual by term four.

""We want to learn from this, we must learn from this and so I'm not going to point any fingers at this stage except to say our focus right now is to ensure that this school is up and running as quickly as possible,"" he said.

The Government does not expect taxpayers will have to foot the bill for repairs.

Over the past few weeks, the ABC has reported on the widespread problem of building defects in the ACT. 

Leaking roofs and basements along with a lack of waterproofing are among the most common defects which have hit unit owners. 

But when it comes to getting the defects fixed, owners face a tough battle, whether going through the ACT Government regulator or the court system. 

Cecilia Wood has spent almost two years in a battle to fix her townhouse in Tuggeranong.

It was supposed to be her dream home but the dream quickly soured when serious defects were discovered. 

""We have a situation where the water is pooling on the balcony, and has caused cracks in the masonry, and is penetrating through the balcony into the interior,"" Ms Wood said.

An independent report by a building inspector found the balcony did not meet the building code.

Getting nowhere with the builder, Ms Wood lodged a complaint with the ACT Government's building regulator, which in turn ordered the builder to fix the defect. The builder simply ignored the rectification order. 

""In effect the builder has told ACTPLA 'up yours' and he's done the same to us,"" she said.

The director of construction services at the Environment and Sustainable Development Directorate (ESDD), Craig Simmons, says even if a builder is recalcitrant, it has the power to ensure defects in contravention to the building code are fixed.

""The territory has the power to act as rectifier of last resort,"" he said.

""Where the territory steps in and undertakes the work and then bills the licensee for that work.""

Ms Wood says that is what the regulator told her it would do if worst came to worst. 

""They assured us that whatever happened, in having made the formal complaint, the legislation would allow ACTPLA to make sure our balcony was properly rectified,"" she said.

However 17 months after lodging her complaint, the directorate has now told her that it does not have the money to finance the rectification works, but it will pursue the builder and consider disciplinary action.

""We were told to trust the system,"" Ms Wood said. 

""We put our faith in the legislation.  We were told the legislation was strong and would be enforced. Now we're being told you're on your own.""

ESDD says there are currently about 20 rectification orders out on builders, but getting them to comply can be a slow process. 

""Every order that we issue has a right of appeal against it, and unfortunately those appeal processes, they can take quite some time,"" Mr Simmons said.

Currently rectification orders are not made public making it difficult for consumers to research builders. 

However the ABC has confirmed some of those facing current orders. They include: 

Michael Koundouris who has been the director of a number of construction companies including: 

Instead of going through government channels, often owners and body corporates choose to pursue the builder through the courts.

Some builders are happy to tie up matters in the courts, knowing the legal fees are enough to deter some.

Geoff Spackman was one of those who decided a legal challenge was just too costly against builders and developers who have much deeper pockets.

He bought a unit from local developers Doma, but soon discovered the apartment complex was riddled with problems like leaking roofs and bathrooms that were not waterproofed.

Doma says they were the developers, not the builders, and building defects are the responsibility of the construction company.

Mr Spackman says the builder did fix some of the defects, but refused to deal with others, leaving the unit owners to foot the repair bill.

""It's in the hundreds of thousands of dollars,"" he said of the cost to owners.

""Doma have certainly let us down for sure.

""This building is a brilliant building now, structurally it really is, it's a credit to whoever designed it. It's a beautiful looking building, and we've got all the problems sorted, but the thing is it cost us a lot of money to do it.""

Mr Spackman blames the system that allows those in the industry to get away with providing poor quality products.

Building defects are inevitable and reputable builders will fix problems as they arise.

But a seemingly impotent regulator and a court system favouring those with deep pockets has allowed many builders to get away with producing work that is not only of poor quality, but also not even meeting the mandatory standards.

In the end, the people who end up having to fix the shoddy work are the consumers.

And a hefty repair bill is what Cecilia Wood is facing.

""We spent over $500,000 on our home,"" she said.

""This was our primary asset, this was not a decision we took lightly, and we trusted the process and we trusted the system, and obviously we were fools to do so.""

In 2010, ABC Stateline exposed widespread problems of building defects in new units and apartments, from minor cracks and falling render to major water leaks.  

It prompted a Government report into the quality of building, which made a raft of recommendations. 

But more than three years on, unit owners along with the Master Builders Association (MBA) say little has changed. 

""It's a fairly ad hoc approach and I don't think it's pulling together that well,"" said MBA deputy executive director Jerry Howard.

""I certainly have concerns about the way it's working, and I think there's probably a lack of engagement with the key players in the industry."" 

The then planning minister, Andrew Barr, said he wanted to extend building warranties, create a building defects fund, and name and shame dodgy builders.

None of that has happened. 

""I don't think we're going to see any real government action that's really firm until a little while yet, so in that sense it's pretty disappointing,"" said Gary Petherbridge of the Owners Corporation Network.

Peter Grills has a story that will be familiar to many unit owners. 

Five years ago he bought a newly built unit, only to discover a short time later that it had significant defects. 

Like many buildings, the basement leaks and so do the ceilings.

""We just assumed that the certifier must have certified that there was a proper waterproofing system, and we discovered that certifiers don't even inspect that,"" he said.

Substandard waterproofing is a problem that the Government's own 2010 report acknowledged.

In fact, its very first recommendation was to introduce mandatory inspections of wet areas and waterproofing. 

Asked why the Government has not acted on the recommendation, Planning Minister Simon Corbell says it is not as simple as it seems.

""For example many of these professions are not regulated. There's currently no regulatory framework for a number of these professions,"" he said.

""Someone who lays down waterproofing is not a regulated trade.""

But the MBA says having mandatory checks at critical points during a build is essential in preventing major defects. 

Mr Corbell says the Government has done a lot of work to improve the building sector, including legislating to increase penalties for builders who breach the Building Act.

""In the coming financial year we will be rewriting the Building Act as a whole to bring it up to date, to improve consumer protections and to focus very strongly on building quality,"" he said.

He rejects the Master Builders' call for an independent review of the whole industry, arguing the Government knows what the problems are.

He says the Government has been clear from the start that the reforms would take three to four years to implement.

A recent inspection of the heritage School of the Arts Hall found a number of building defects including decay, rust, electrical problems, asbestos and potential fire hazards.

The council suspended use of the hall late last year due to the safety concerns.

The Mayor, Bill Murray, says a number of options are being considered, including repairing or replacing the building, demolishing or selling it.

""The cost of it for the usage of it doesn't work together, so we'll have to have a community meeting and see what they'd like to do for the hall,"" he said.

The tallest apartment building in the country does not meet fire safety standards demanded by the Australian building code, yet it was certified as fit for occupation.

Laddie Assey is a mechanical engineer who owns an apartment in the Q1 tower - Australia's tallest residential building - at Surfers Paradise in south-east Queensland.

What he identified back in 2005 was, in the case of a major fire, one of the two escape routes from the tower would be seriously compromised.

""It's a very serious public issue. In terms of people, the occupants of the building, there's more than 1,000 people, 526 apartments,"" he said.

Due to a design problem, the northern fire stairwell could quickly fill with smoke and people would die from asphyxiation before they could escape.

Around three million Australians live in strata title apartment buildings, and according to recent studies, that number is only going to increase.

A recent study by the University of New South Wales (UNSW) found 15 per cent of unit owners surveyed reported a lack of, or defective, fire safety measures in their buildings.

The UNSW study only surveyed strata title owners in that state, but Mark Lever of Strata Community Australia, said the report could have been written anywhere else in Australia.

""This issue of defects is a major one for the sector. The issue is how they are resolved, who is accountable, and who pays for them,"" he said.

One reason given for the increasing number of building defects is a breakdown in the process of building certification.

The police of the building industry are the certifiers, or building surveyors.

They give a tick at the end of construction indicating that everything is OK and the building is safe for occupation.

On Mr Assey's first evening in his Q1 apartment, he took his trash to the garbage room on his floor and discovered the room was also the entrance to the fire stairwell.

Having inflammable rubbish in a fire exit does not comply with the Australian building code.

And there was a more serious problem. The stair pressurisation - the ventilation system that keeps smoke out of the stairs - would not work effectively because the garbage room was the entrance path to the fire stairs.

This northern stairwell, one of two escape routes, starting at level three and ending at level 76, would be seriously compromised if there was a fire.

In a 2008 email to the Q1 body corporate management group Mr Assey wrote:

""Simply put, if there is a fire, smoke will enter into the stair at the rate of 1.7 metres per second, killing anyone on the way down from any floor by asphyxiation in the time taken to walk down the 76 levels to the ground floor.""

Mr Assey also complained to the Queensland Building Services Authority (QBSA) about what he saw as a failure in the building certification process.

From 2008 to 2012, several expert reports have been commissioned.

None of the reports contradicted Mr Assey's original assessment from 2005 that the northern stairwell did not comply with the building code or Australian fire standards.

Almost four years later, the QBSA told Background Briefing it was a ""complex  complaint"".

Ian Jennings, general manager of the QBSA, said the reason it took so long was because ""you're talking about all sorts of things to do with the fire system in a fairly tall building.

""We made an assessment and we had discussions with the people and the agencies that had been involved. It was deemed not to be a fire safety risk to the occupants.""

Technical director of Fire Protection Australia, Matthew Wright, believes people expect new buildings to be designed to high safety standards and someone is going to be responsible for checking that it occurs.

""At the end of the day someone needs to check that the design demonstrates compliance before construction commences,"" Mr Wright said.

In the case of the Q1 tower, the stair pressurisation in the northern fire escape was not compliant with Australian standards - yet somehow this was missed in the certification process.

The certification of Q1 was done by the Gold Coast Building Certification group, a business unit of the Gold Coast City Council.

The council told the ABC: ""Any questions about certification of the Q1 should be handled by the Building regulator, the QBSA.""

The QBSA said after consultation with the developers, Gold Coast Council and the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service, an ""alternative solution"" had been proposed and that no one would be reprimanded for the mistake.

In the technical language of building construction, if there is a design problem that does not comply with the building code, you work out an ""alternative solution"".

But these solutions are meant to be worked out and approved at the time the building is designed.

Going ""alternative"" years after construction is ""the worst of all worlds"", according to Professor Jose Torero of the University of Queensland.

He is an international authority on fire safety in super tall buildings.

""When you already have a building and the building has been operating, and you actually realise that something might not be working correctly... you have to implement the alternative solution to what will be a significant cost,"" he said.

""Most likely the outcome will never be as good as it could have been if it had been implemented correctly in the design process.""

Last week Planning Minister Andrew Barr wrote to the building industry telling it to lift its game.

The letter came after the ABC's Stateline program revealed widespread concerns about substandard building practices in residential unit developments across Canberra.

Mr Barr flagged a number of proposals in his letter to the industry, such as naming and shaming dodgy builders.

He is also proposing increasing the number of inspections during the construction stage and the creation of a building defects fund to pay for repairs if faults arise after construction.

The ACT Planning and Land Authority (ACTPLA) will meet with the building industry monitoring group this afternoon.

ACTPLA's Neil Savery says ways to address poor quality workmanship will be top of the agenda.

He says the industry has had enough time to come up with solutions.

The ABC understands the Attorney General Steve Kons is planning to ditch the mandatory home owners' warranty insurance system in favour of other consumer protection measures.

Home owners are required to take out the insurance to guard against building defects, but because it is a last resort system claims can only be made if a builder dies, disappears or becomes insolvent.

The Greens' Infrastructure spokesman Kim Booth says it has failed both consumers and builders.

""It's really a kind of phantom insurance, it's not the sort of insurance that the consumer thinks they're getting,"" said Mr Kons.

""They sail into a building project thinking that they've paid this compulsory insurance to be protected but then they find that they're just led into a quagmire of litigation and costs.''

Queensland is the only state that has not introduced the mandatory scheme and Tasmania would become the first to dump it.

Passengers travelling on the north shore, northern and western train lines are facing delays due to urgent overhead wiring repairs at Hornsby.

The Transport Management Centre said there are ""major delays"" for passengers on the T1 North Shore Line, T9 Northern Line and also service disruptions on the T1 Western Line.

Buses are supplementing services, but passengers should allow extra travel time.

Trains will make additional stops on the Central Coast and Newcastle Line as well as on the Blue Mountains line.

The NSW Building Commissioner has warned that owners of buildings with defects will not be bailed out by the Government.

""There isn't a glove that's going to land around them and write a cheque to rectify [the problems],"" he said during a parliamentary inquiry into the state's building standards.

He added that in instances where there was not a building company to seek damages from, owners would ""have to stump and get that work done"".

The State Government will this week again attempt to get through the Upper House its Building Practitioners Bill, which aims to provide a legislative framework to better regulate the industry.

NSW Police say they have ""serious concerns"" for the welfare of a 26-year-old woman who went missing from Sydney's south almost two weeks ago.

Authorities said Chloe Baxendale was last seen leaving a unit complex in Unwin Street in Bexley on February 14, 2020.

She was reported missing by her family after they were unable to get in contact with her.

She is described as being of Caucasian appearance, between 160-165 centimetres tall, of a thin build, with long blonde hair and blue eyes and has a tattoo down her spine and an eye tattoo on her left wrist.

Wildlife experts and koala conservation organisations will gather at Parliament House in Canberra today to discuss strategies for supporting the recovery of the treasured species in the wake of the devastating NSW bushfires.

Federal Environment Minister Sussan Ley said it was unclear how many koalas perished and were injured in the fires, but northern NSW and southern Queensland were among the hardest-hit areas.

She said today's workshop and ministerial roundtable would bring together zookeepers, wildlife carers and koala researchers to look at how to best support the recovery effort.

""I'm confident that we will continue to have good koala numbers in the eastern states … we will gather the information we need to absolutely give these animals the best possible chance.""

A survey of 700 primary schools across the nation has found that anxiety among students is a significant and growing issue within the primary school system.

The survey, conducted by the Australian Primary Principals Association, found 80 per cent of school leaders regarded anxiety as a big problem, which they felt they did not have the resources to deal with.

The association's president, Malcolm Elliott, said he believed the increasing use of social media and competitiveness are probably factors in the rise in anxiety levels.

""It manifests itself in children at one end of the spectrum not even coming along to school … too concerned about their social relationships and their performance at school that they don't even come,"" he said.

Stage one of the precinct includes about 270 apartments across five separate towers which were completed in 2019.

The ""critically urgent"" issue with the fire stairs in Building D was detailed in a building management report issued in June, which said it was first raised in April.

It listed the issue as ""Incomplete Fire Stair: Drops to certain death or disability"".

The report found that while the hole was addressed in April, a gap still existed in the stairs two months later that was large enough ""children may still fall through"".

It also warned the existing hole could impede the stair pressurisation fans, used to protect occupants in the event of a fire.

About 20 other defects were also listed in the report that the developer has agreed to rectify.

They include water leaks throughout several levels of the basement, cracks in an exterior podium, and a sewer station which has been fixed after coming ""very close to flooding multiple lower units"" due to incorrectly installed pumps.

But Piety Group has declined to rectify several other issues it said were maintenance matters including water pooling outside Building D, cracked tiles at the entrance to Building E, and efflorescence (residual marks) on an exterior stairway.

A Piety Group spokeswoman said the company was committed to fixing all building-related defects.

She said the ""void"" in the stairwell was ""secured"" when it was first raised and that it was addressed again after the June report warned it still posed a risk.

""There is a void at the bottom of the Building D stairwell which will serve a future stage and has been secured,"" she said.

""When the building manager recently notified us of an issue with the current security of the void, it was secured within 24 hours.""

She also said work was still being done to determine the source of the water leaks throughout the basement. 

""As with any water leak, it is a process of elimination,"" she said.

""We are committed to fixing all water leaks.""

The spokeswoman said the company believed wet wipes were to blame for the sewer system backing up. 

""A plumber advised the building manager that the issue was caused by residents flushing wet wipes down the toilet.""

A conference for the building and construction industry was held in Darwin on Friday, with panellists representing the legal, building, development, insurance and public sectors.

The event follows a shaky few years for the sector.

Neil Sunners, the director of developer Sunbuild, told the conference professionals should not cut corners on structural costs.

""Yes there are code issues I believe, that there definitely could be, standards could be lifted, for sure, but I think also you don't have to follow them [codes] as I said, they're a minimum,"" he said.

""As you all know, that's got consequences, we've all got to dig a bit deeper guys in our pockets to actually pay for that quality and longevity, but now we can start to understand why it is more important to spend a little more money on getting the building right in the first place.""

Mr Sunners was also critical of the fact that building licences were not necessary for builders or developers when constructing buildings taller than three storeys.

""I believe there should be qualifications for that type of thing . . . any one of us in the room could go and build a high rise but you've got to be registered to be under three storeys, that's just wrong in and of itself,"" he told the conference.

""If the authorities don't give controls, as hard as that might sound to all of us, but if there's no rules and regulations from the authority level, there will be people who cheat and cut corners.""

The Northern Territory Government said it was looking at that regulatory issue as it worked to implement the recommendations from a wide-ranging 2018 report into the industry.

""That is one of the recommendations of the Building Confidence Report and that is one the NT does fall a bit short on,"" said Mark Meldrum, the director of building control at the NT Department of Infrastructure, Planning and Logistics (DIPL).

A Darwin lawyer also told the conference the current legal options for owners in high-rise buildings were insufficient. 

""It was completely foreseeable, frankly, that there was going to be issues arising with people's rights to be able to recover compensation for defective buildings,"" said Cris Cureton, a partner at Squire Patton Boggs.

He said owners of units in buildings taller than three storeys had few legal options if they wanted to claim compensation for building faults.

""So there's also a significant gap in terms of the options, other than going and seeing your lawyer and trying to spend large amounts of money trying to sue people,"" Mr Cureton said.

""It just seems to be quite odd that these people that are particularly vulnerable, these unit holders that buy off the plan and people that subsequently purchase units in multi-storey constructions are left in such a vulnerable state.""

The NT DIPL said it had met about half of the 24 recommendations from the Building Confidence Report, and was working on the others.

2021-10-28,ABC,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-09/nt-government-calls-for-review-amid-darwin-building-concerns/11395322,2019-08-09,NT Chief Minister says buyers of structurally flawed buildings should have been warned - ABC News,"Prospective buyers of units in nine buildings in the Northern Territory found to be in breach of the National Construction Code should have been told of the structural issues, Chief Minister Michael Gunner has said.

A ministerial briefing obtained by the ABC through the Freedom of Information Act shows the Department of Infrastructure, Planning and Logistics [DIPL] received a report in January 2018 ""concluding that all nine buildings were non-compliant"".

But it took another 15 months before the issue was publicly disclosed, when DIPL sent notices ordering unit owners to rectify concrete transfer slabs that did not meet national standards.

The ABC has revealed at least five apartments, in Darwin and Palmerston, were sold to unwitting buyers during that 15-month period, including a penthouse suite that was purchased for $1 million just two weeks before DIPL revealed the issue in April this year.

Unit owners in that building are now facing a rectification bill of more than $1.5 million.

""We are concerned about the time it took for people to know the transparency,"" Mr Gunner said.

""There should have been, in our opinion, greater transparency around this.""

Mr Gunner said Infrastructure Minister Eva Lawler had directed her department to undertake an immediate review.

""[To find out] what happened and how we can do better in going forward so that people have got certainty and security,"" Mr Gunner said.

A Darwin lawyer in the construction sector said unit owners caught up in the building breaches had ""limited legal avenues"" to seek compensation.

""It's a very challenging situation [unit owners] are in,"" Cris Cureton said.

In 2015, Mr Cureton headed a review — commissioned by the former Country Liberals government — of the NT building industry's regulatory framework.

Mr Cureton, who is representing some of the affected parties in the non-compliance issue, said the problems now emerging were ""foreseeable"" but that his recommendations to improve protections for unit owners were never implemented.

One potential option is for unit owners is to seek compensation through the Northern Territory's warranty scheme for residential buildings, known as the Fidelity Fund.

To access the fund, a trigger event needs to occur, such as when a builder dies, disappears or becomes insolvent.

None of the triggers have occurred to date but could do so before the six-year limitation on claims for the Fidelity Fund passes.

However, the fund only applies to buildings up to three storeys high, which would exclude at least four of the nine non-compliant buildings because they are too tall. 

Mr Cureton's 2015 review recommended the fund be expanded to high-rise buildings. 

""It was foreseeable, which is why the report made the recommendations in the first place: that body corporates, particularly of high-rise constructions ... were in a very difficult legal position if there was a defective building that they had to address,"" Mr Cureton said.

""And these recommendations would have assisted to try and provide alternative avenues of funds if things happened that have subsequently transpired.""

The Fidelity Fund is administered by the Master Builders Association NT, which said Mr Cureton's 2015 recommendations were impractical.

""Right across the country we've seen investigations into high-rise developments, and they have never been able to land on a solution which is cost-effective,"" the association's executive director David Malone said.

""We think that the best way to deal with this is to actually have the right order and compliance regime in place.""

DIPL said the transfer slabs were all designed and certified by the same structural engineer, John Scott of JWS Consulting.

DIPL has referred Mr Scott to the Building Practitioners Board, which will hold an inquiry into alleged professional misconduct later this month.

The chairman of a company that owns one of the affected buildings in Palmerston said the non-compliance issue highlighted broader problems affecting the national construction industry. 

""What's clear is the engineering and the building certification has let people down around the country,"" said Allan McGill, who chairs affordable rental company Venture Housing. 

""Most people have had confidence and faith in the process to ensure their buildings are structurally sound.

""But it seems to be we've been let down a bit nationally on that.""

Ms Lawler acknowledged that regulatory oversight of builders and engineers had been weakened over recent decades.

""We'd gone from an industry that was regulated quite highly through government (certifiers), and then over time there was less regulation and more self-regulation,"" Ms Lawler said.

""And so, we've seen the building industry regulating their own work through independent certifiers.""

Ms Lawler said the NT Government was considering recommendations made in a national review into the building industry last year, including mandatory independent reviews of structural designs.

No timeline, however, has been set for implementing any changes.

Two weeks on from the federal budget, the big banks are failing in their attempts to muster any sort of meaningful support for a campaign against the Government's $6 billion tax impost.

With scandal after scandal, where innocent ordinary people have been badly hurt, the banks' reputations are mud.

In recent times, the Commonwealth Bank's insurance arm, CommInsure, has been in the headlines for the heavy-handed way it has treated customers trying to make claims on their life insurance policies.

Now CommInsure's general insurance division is showing the same mean spirit.

In 2015, as a result of some of the worst storms in many years, a big tree crashed through the kitchen roof of Meri Pomery at Oatley in Sydney's south.

The damage was extensive, but Ms Pomery thought it would be quickly fixed when she lodged a claim with her insurer CommInsure.

She was wrong.

""I put my trust in CommInsure and they've played games with me. They've used tricks on me. They made me believe from the beginning they were going to fix this house,"" she lamented.

Two-and-a-half years on, Ms Pomery's house - with its million-dollar-views across the George's River - is an unliveable construction site.

The big holes in the roof were left unrepaired for two of those years.

""Every time it rained, the water came through on the tarp. The tarp would either fall and then you had water running right through the whole level, till the end, and you'd have water dripping,"" Ms Pomery explained.

Ms Pomery said it has been a constant battle with CommInsure. When their chosen builders (a company called Dak Wal) did arrive, their sub-standard work made a bad situation worse.

An independent builder, who reviewed Dak Wal's work refused to be publicly identified because of his fears of retribution from CommInsure.

However, in his report, he wrote:

All around the property there are signs of incompetence.

A wardrobe has sat outside the front door all year under covering that is not weatherproof. 

At the riverfront, heavy metal scaffolding, brought in by boat, was dumped on the timber pontoon, causing significant damage.

Much of that scaffolding now lies abandoned nearby.

Expensive furniture, that was meant to be removed, has been piled up by the builders in a downstairs room, much to the disgust of Ms Pomery.

""There's marks, scratches, dents, there's footprints all through my furniture,"" she said.     

Meri Pomery's story is not an isolated one.

In its most recent annual report, the Financial Ombudsman Service recorded a 34 per cent increase in disputes involving general insurers - to 6,858.

More than two-thirds of those disputes involved insurers refusing to pay claims. 

Insurance law specialist, Josh Mennen, from law firm Maurice Blackburn, says extreme weather conditions played a big part in that.

""Last year and early-2017 saw quite a number of significant events in terms of natural disasters with the ex-cyclone Debbie and also New South Wales bushfires.""

""And so that would have caused a huge spike in claims being made and that would have flowed through into a proportion of those being disputed."" 

But while Mr Mennen believes general insurers on the whole behave well, he says the bigger the benefit the harder the fight.

""Particularly where there's shoddy workmanship conducted by the insurer's remediators, or builders, and so that can result in for example, mould infestation and other rectification works that need to be made. That all increases the price which, of course, incentivises the insurer to dispute the claim."" 

As Ms Pomery has battled to get her house liveable again, CommInsure commissioned a report by a building consultant called Sergon.

Part of that report is called 'Scope of Work for the Repair of Defective Building Work"" and it contains three closely typed pages of items that need fixing.

However, despite commissioning the report, CommInsure is refusing to commit to its findings.

It's a battle that's taken its toll on Ms Pomery's fashion business, and her health.

""I had breast cancer and I fought that. When CommInsure came along and I fought them. And over the last two years it's like one of the biggest fights of my life."" 

CommInsure has told the ABC it could have done better in the Pomery case.

As a result, it has promised higher standards from builders who work for CommInsure.

The reality though is that a house which could have been fixed for tens of thousands of dollars will now cost hundreds of thousands.

Another example of why few are prepared to defend the banks in the face of the Government's $6 billion budget tax grab.

2021-10-28,ABC,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-07-03/ray-hadley-and-sydney-developer-toplace-on-legal-collision-court/100259794,2021-07-02,'Defective' apartment developer and Sydney shock-jock Ray Hadley on legal collision course - ABC News,"A string of ""defective"" residential buildings across Sydney, constructed by developer Toplace, has been revealed as part of a court battle between the company and shock-jock Ray Hadley.

Company director and founder Jean Nassif filed a defamation action against Hadley and 2GB last year, over a series of broadcasts in 2019 and 2020.

During his radio program, Hadley raised particular concerns about the Atmosphere apartment complex at Castle Hill, built by Toplace in 2018.

In a statement of claim filed to the Federal Court, Mr Nassif said the broadcaster incorrectly inferred he was a ""dishonest"" and ""shoddy"" developer and that he attempted to force apartment buyers to settle when the buildings were ""dangerously unfit for habitation"". 

It's the same company that was also ordered by the NSW Building Commissioner last month to fix a range of defects, after ""extensive signs of cracking"" were found in the basement of its Skyview apartment complex in Castle Hill.

Toplace was also recently ordered by NSW Fair Trading to rectify non-compliant cladding on the outside of the Atmosphere apartments after inspectors found it was not properly water-proofed.

Hadley filed his defence to the court, arguing his comments were true and of his own opinion, a move that has now been rejected by solicitors acting for Mr Nassif.

The broadcaster included evidence to show council inspectors had found fire and safety issues within the Atmosphere apartments, and he also referenced a list of other Toplace developments where owners were suing over alleged defects. 

The list includes the Parramatta Rise and the Riviera apartments in Parramatta, Vicinity Development in Canterbury, Jolyn Place in Rosebery and the Park Gove Development in Botany.

Quantity surveyors who inspected the Park Grove apartments found owners would have to find $11 million for rectification work to fix the defects, according to the defence statement.

Hadley's submissions also included a letter from the Hills Shire Council to the NSW Building Professionals Board stating the Atmosphere apartments in Castle Hill were not suitable for residents when the occupation certificate was issued, after fire safety issues were discovered like insufficient sprinkler coverage.

""The health and safety of occupants has not been duly considered before the occupation certificate was issued and the building [was] not currently suitable for occupation or use in accordance with its classification under the Building Code of Australia,"" said the letter, dated September 2018. 

Hadley's statement argued Mr Nassif and his companies should have ensured the buildings were fit for purpose, safe and habitable, before residents settled.

Solicitor Rebekah Giles, who is acting for Mr Nassif, rejected Hadley's defence, stating the accusations during his broadcasts were ""not isolated but made over a period of nearly a year in a daily radio program"". 

In reply to his defence, she said Hadley refused to allow Mr Nassif or another Toplace representative on his radio show to put forward their side of the story.

She said Hadley used ""extravagant and unreasonable language"" to convey his opinions, including one comment on air that he would not ""live in a tent that Mr Nassif was building, let alone a high rise"".

The matter is set for a case management hearing on November 2.

2021-10-28,ABC,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-03/nt-empty-palmerston-community-housing-potentially-defective/100217864,2021-08-02,Palmerston rentals empty as NT government signs new housing contract with developer - ABC News,"Jacinta Benger was excited to be moving into her new home, a two-storey, three-bedroom Palmerston townhouse known locally as one of the ""shipping container units"".

She admired the modular, modern design of the buildings, which had been shortlisted for an urban development award.

She collected the keys in 2016, and became the first person to occupy the newly minted rental she moved into during April that year.

""It was like having our own place, except I didn't have to buy it, so it was awesome,"" she said.

Ms Benger's unit was among a group of developments intended to provide affordable housing in the satellite city south of Darwin.

Instead, all 16 houses are now locked up and empty after teams of inspectors were sent in to scrutinise potential defects.

The Northern Territory government, which paid more than $6 million when it bought the units off the plan in 2013, has released little information about the problems.

However, the ABC has been told at least one inspection raised concerns about the potential impact of the defects on residents' safe movement and liveability.

The first thing Ms Benger, a lifelong Territorian, noticed about her new home was that it seemed to trap heat.

""Obviously Darwin's hot, but they were, like, exceptionally hot,"" she said.

As the tropical wet season approached, Ms Benger and her children would seek refuge in the air-conditioning, racking up quarterly electricity bills in excess of $1,000.

And when the rain finally arrived, she said her problems multiplied.

""There was a leak in the roof from outside and it had leaked down into the fan and the light on the back deck and shorted out the power,"" she said.

""We had to get somebody around to have a look at that, and they found there was water coming down the wall from upstairs.

""That was one of the first kind of things where I thought, well, that's a bit dangerous.""

Over a period of about three years, Ms Benger wrote to her housing provider to raise issues ranging from mosquitoes breeding in water pooling beneath the home's raised bottom floor to a crack in one wall that she said grew and grew. 

Her housing provider, not-for-profit organisation Venture Housing Company, received the buildings from the NT government after they were completed in 2015.

Faced with a growing list of complaints, the company sought professional advice about the houses.

By late 2018, chairman Allan McGill had been handed a compliance report examining how the buildings corresponded to national construction standards. 

He said engineers had identified a large number of potential defects across about half a dozen units they inspected, finding issues including cracked wall linings, damage from water ingress, and interior staircases where no handrails had been installed — contrary to approved designs. 

Their report did not identify who was responsible for the potential defects.

""The concerning bit is the buildings were certified, a certificate of occupancy was issued, but then subsequently to that, there were a whole bunch of defects,"" Mr McGill said.

""Whether that's poor quality products or whether it's workmanship, I'm not sure.""

The report was one of at least two to identify potential defects in the homes, according to Mr McGill, who said the government also commissioned its own assessment.

""So we had two engineering reports. The list had some common items — there were a few that were a bit different, but I think there were a number that both engineering reports identified as being genuine defects,"" Mr McGill said.

But with the company's own report finding that some of the issues identified had a potential impact on the safety and liveability of the homes, Venture Housing Company made the decision in about 2020 to move the residents out.

""We thought we had to go on the side of caution and move them to a safer premises,"" Mr McGill said.

The developer of the 16 homes was Tomazos Group, a prolific construction company behind numerous apartment buildings across Darwin and Palmerston as well as the multi-million dollar, taxpayer-funded State Square car park.

However, Tomazos Group has not admitted responsibility for issues in the Palmerston homes.

Responding to questions over email, managing director John Tomazos said his company was required to finish building the homes after another builder the company engaged went into liquidation in 2014.

He said the main structure of the buildings had already been erected and completed, alongside some of the fit-out, when Tomazos Group took over ""final completion work"".

He said an independent certified engineer and a registered building certifier confirmed that all the work was compliant when the homes were completed and certified.

""Tomazos is presently investigating the claims as to the defects in the buildings,"" Mr Tomazos wrote.

""At a recent inspection it was apparent that some of the buildings have suffered from a lack of maintenance and/or care by [some of] the occupants, resulting in damage to floors and walls.

""However, if Tomazos receives engineering or independent advice that the buildings suffer from defects that are properly described as construction defects caused by Tomazos, Tomazos will stand behind its work and ensure that the work it has performed is rectified to its usual high standard.""

He said the company was not aware of any issue that would prevent the buildings from being safely occupied.

The Department of Infrastructure, Planning and Logistics (DIPL) said it could only release limited information about the houses, citing an ongoing investigation related to the matter.

It confirmed that it received claim applications for a government housing insurance fund in November 2018.

It is unclear if the cause of the potential defects has been identified.

The following year, the housing department entered into a new and separate agreement with Tomazos Group to lease 30 dwellings in an upcoming development for social housing.

The nine-year agreement was signed in September 2019 — two years after the company applied to lease some dwellings to the government — and the development in the Narrows is now nearing completion, according to a housing department spokesperson. 

Urban Housing Minister Kate Worden declined to be interviewed about the agreement, but her spokeswoman emphasised the government had not purchased the dwellings.

""The government has done its due diligence through a robust procurement process when it came to awarding this build,"" she said in a statement. 

""The NT Government also has an Agreement to Lease in place with Tomazos, which will only commence once the building has been fully certified and is ready to occupy.""

Tomazos Group, Venture Housing Company and the Department of Territory Families, Housing and Communities are now working to resolve any issues, with the builder undertaking some recent maintenance and remedial work.

But the saga has had a significant impact on the community housing organisation's finances, as well as its goal to increase the number of affordable dwellings across the NT.

""The stock of available housing for low-income people is almost non-existent really. The waiting list is long. So that didn't help us,"" Mr McGill said.

""But it also hasn't helped our balance sheet — our assets.""

The company's 2019-20 annual report said the costs of engineering reports and legal advice was growing for both it and the government ""with no sign of resolution in sight"".

Its report from a year earlier recorded a decrease of more than $4.5 million for lost market value and impairments across the 16 properties.

The company is now hoping to recover some losses through the insurance claims, and will consider the future of the homes once a list of remaining potential defects is resolved.

Mr McGill also said the housing department was contributing some of the money Venture Housing Company has lost on rent from the premises, but the department spokesperson would not confirm that or say how much had been paid.

Revisiting her former home one afternoon in June, Ms Benger was disappointed to see it still standing vacant.

""It feels like a bit of a failure,"" she said.

""In the middle of a rental crisis, these places are sitting here empty. 

""It's pretty sad really.""

The Northern Territory's residential construction sector has been mired in problems over the past few years, including when about 200 unit owners across were told their buildings, across Darwin and Palmerston, did not meet the National Construction Code. 

One of those buildings is also owned by Venture Housing Company. 

Last year, the owners of a separate group of 18 affordable houses in Palmerston were told to seek alternative shelter during cyclones, with both the builder and developer denying responsibility for various non-compliance issues.

Toplace Group's Skyview apartment complex in Castle Hill will consist of about 960 ""luxurious"" one, two and three-bedroom apartments, many of which have already been sold off-the-plan.

But a team of inspectors from NSW Fair Trading has reported finding ""the existence of structural issues that would require specialist engineering advice"" as the company seeks occupation certificates for two of its five towers.

While two towers are almost ready, the third and fourth are under construction and the fifth is yet to be built.

Toplace has refuted the concerns, saying it has ""absolute faith"" in its work and private structural engineers had cleared the buildings.

The fresh inspection by Fair Trading comes after ABC News and several MPs received images of the development's basement during construction earlier this year, from an industry whistle-blower asking for an investigation into uneven concrete. 

Toplace subsequently allowed ABC News to tour the basement where remediation work appeared to include metal plates bolted across concrete joints.

ABC News has spoken to several independent structural engineers who said the images sent by the whistle-blower warranted a review.

Director of SCP Engineers and Development Consultants Paul Siewert said the photos appeared to indicate ""failure of the slab connection resulting in slab settlement and loss of support"" — something that would require remediation work.

""Whilst the cause may be either design or construction related or both, the result is significant remedial work would need to be undertaken to restore the structural integrity and fire rating compliance.""

The development is currently under review by its third private certifier, City Plan Services, which was appointed in March, after its first certifier was deregistered and its second resigned.

Upon appointment, City Plan Services informed the NSW Building Commissioner it had concerns about previous certification work but had reached an understanding with the developer that the previous work would be thoroughly reviewed.

City Plan Services issued the company with a Written Direction Notice requiring the appointment of an independent engineer to undertake a review of the buildings, which is now underway.

Details of the fresh inspection by Fair Trading officers were outlined by NSW's Minister for Better Regulation, Kevin Anderson, in a letter to Greens MP David Shoebridge — one of the politicians who referred the matter to the Building Commissioner after receiving information from the whistle-blower.

""Following the receipt of your letter, even though there was already action being taken at the development arising from the certifier performing his functions, Fair Trading sent a team of authorised officers to the site on 16 April 2021,"" Minister Anderson wrote.

""This inspection confirmed the existence of structural issues that would require specialist engineering advice and that the certifier was appropriately handling the matter.""

The Office of NSW Building Commissioner David Chandler said it was aware of allegations of ""defects"" but had full faith in the certifier's review.

""The Office of the Building Commissioner is aware that there have been allegations of serious defects existing at the Skyview Building that is still under construction,"" said a spokeswoman.

""Occupation certificate inspectors from the department have inspected the relevant work and identified that the matter is being managed appropriately by a private certifier.

The Building Commissioner's office is then expected to undertake its own independent audit of the expert reports.

According to NSW law, new developments must be given an occupation certificate as the final step in a construction process before residents are allowed to move into a completed part of the building.

The review comes amid growing public concern over the standards of construction work in NSW, after high-profile buildings had to be evacuated in Sydney over the past three years.

In 2018, hundreds of residents were forced to evacuate the Opal Tower at Olympic Park after cracks started to appear in the building's concrete beams.

In 2019, Mascot Towers in Sydney' south were evacuated amid fears one of the buildings could collapse.

Residents have been unable to return to their homes since many of the 132 apartment owners left financially destitute.

Greens MP David Shoebridge said the public deserved to be informed of the progress of the review into the Skyview development.

""I'm glad to see that it's on the Building Commissioner's radar,"" he said.

""We raised it with him directly and the government because we were so concerned.""

NSW Labor spokeswoman for building reform Yasmin Catley also requested a review after receiving the same information.

""The Building Commissioner needs to get involved, he needs to utilize everything that is at his fingertips,"" she said.

After raising concerns with Toplace, a team of construction managers from the company provided ABC News with a tour of the basement showcasing recent ""remediation"" work.

It included a series of metal plates bolted between concrete slabs in the shared basement beneath the towers.

A Toplace spokesperson completely rejected allegations of structural problems and said aside from ""aesthetic defects"", the buildings had no other issues.

""We have opened the building completely to inspection by the ABC,"" they said.

""The building has been subject to unfounded and malicious allegations. 

""The building has been found to be entirely sound and built to a high standard. 

""Issues were first raised in January 2020.

They said one engineering firm sourced by Toplace had previously given its own tick of approval over the remediation work, while another company provided a peer review.

""Remediation works began at that time with design solutions. Continued inspections and monitoring occurred and first physical works occurred mid-2020.

""Remediation work occurred from January 2020 and were completed before 22 February 2021. 

""Sign-off has been provided by the relevant authorised consultants/contractors for all elements of the site without issue. 

""On that basis there are no issues across the site.""

Toplace said the photos sent to MPs depicted expansion joints ""designed into the building to permit the slabs to move as the concrete expands and contracts"".

Editor's note, July 29, 2021: In July 2021, the Office of the NSW Building Commissioner lifted a Prohibition Order on the Skyview development, after accepting defects had been remediated and Toplace had agreed to be liable for any structural issues identified over the next 20 years. As part of the arrangement, Toplace also agreed to source an independent engineer to monitor the buildings for at least 10 years and secure $11 million worth of insurance bonds or cash guarantees to fund rectification work, should matters arise in the future.

2021-10-28,ABC,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-10/combustible-cladding-creates-extreme-risk-in-sa-buildings/11589456,2019-10-10,'Extreme risk' identified in SA buildings due to combustible cladding - ABC News,"An audit has revealed 30 South Australian buildings require urgent remedial work to deal with potentially flammable aluminium cladding — but the State Government is refusing to identify which ones are at risk.

The buildings have been identified in a statewide review, which was launched in mid-2017 in the wake of London's Grenfell Tower fire which killed 72 people.

Tenants could be forced to cover some of the costs of remediation, after the State Government ruled out following Victoria, which invested hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to reduce the fire risk.

The State Government audit interim report has determined seven privately-owned buildings are at ""extreme risk"" and require immediate action and remedial work.

A further 21 privately-owned buildings have been assessed as ""high risk"", meaning remedial action should be carried out in the next 12 months.

According to State Government briefing documents, the 28 privately-owned buildings are ""primarily multistorey residential apartment buildings"".

Two publicly-owned buildings have also been identified as ""high risk"".

Infrastructure Minister Stephan Knoll said one of those buildings was under construction and not currently open to the public.

He said works were underway to reduce the building's risk to an ""acceptable level"".

""The other publicly-owned building is a small ablution block and I'm advised that remediation works are being carried out over the coming weeks,"" Mr Knoll said.

""We will quite clearly be keeping very strong oversight over those private buildings and making sure those remediation works do progress. And we'll reserve our rights on future actions should that not progress in the way that we expect.""

The Minister declined to identify which buildings were at risk, saying that responsibility would fall to building owners.

""Security and safety have always been one of the primary reasons that we do not reveal the exact locations of buildings with significant cladding issues in line with other states,"" he said.

""We don't want to put a massive sign on the front of a building to say to an arsonist 'come here, and you can wreak havoc'.

""It is our expectation that building owners will notify occupants of their respective buildings and keep them informed throughout the remediation process as appropriate.

""None of these buildings has been assessed as needing to have the occupants evacuated. All of these buildings are buildings in the short-term that are able to be occupied.""

Mr Knoll acknowledged that owners of apartments in affected buildings could be called upon to help pay for the cost of remediation.

In July, the Victorian Government announced a $600 million plan, half-funded by taxpayers, to rectify safety risks in about 500 buildings with aluminium composite cladding. 

However, Mr Knoll said SA taxpayers would not be called upon to help, and said it was a ""matter for the private building owners"" as well as builders and insurers. 

""We expect those existing processes to be used to fix it,"" he said.

The Minister said building owners had a ""duty of care"" to notify tenants in affected buildings of the potential danger, and said it would also be up to South Australian councils to ensure that the owners of private buildings took necessary work to reduce the risk.

""The [Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure] will be working very closely with councils and building owners to ensure remediation works are carried out and these buildings meet the acceptable standard,"" he said.

""The way that we deal with defects in buildings essentially places the responsibility with councils under the Development Act to be able to have that discussion with building owners.

""We firmly expect building owners to take their duty of care seriously and have those conversations with the occupants inside those buildings.

""Targeted recladding of some high-risk areas, in a number of situations, will be sufficient to reduce the life safety risk.""

Opposition infrastructure spokesman Tom Koutsantonis slammed the State Government for withholding information, saying it was ""unacceptable"" that the buildings had not been publicly identified.

""Inform people, let them know what the risks are … let them know the building you are in — the building you are working in, the building you are living in, the building you are sleeping in — is unsafe,"" he said.

""People in these buildings have a right to know.

""They need to make their own decisions about their families, they need to make financial decisions about insurance.""

CFMEU assistant national secretary Andrew Sutherland shared those concerns, saying he was ""appalled"".

""I can't understand how they can be putting the tenants of those buildings at risk and in the same breath be saying they've got the safety of all South Australians at the forefront,"" he said.

""It's two years since the Grenfell fire and here we are — one of the buildings that is publicly owned is still under construction and is containing the flammable [aluminium composite] panels.""

Mr Knoll said the remedial actions would include removing aluminium composite panels from around exits, firefighting equipment and balconies, and in some circumstances removing the cladding from the first three metres above ground.

He said in some circumstances, owners would be required to install automatic fire suppression systems, sprinklers, fire extinguishers, smoke alarms, automatic fire doors or fire control systems.

Buildings identified in the audit will be automatically added to the Metropolitan Fire Service's dispatch system, so firefighters would be automatically alerted to the risks in the event of a fire.

The statewide audit began a month after London's Grenfell Tower fire, and involved assessing 17,000 publicly-owned buildings.

Four public buildings were prioritised for investigation last year, including the Adelaide Convention Centre, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Women's and Children's Hospital and Adelaide Oval.

In August, the ABC revealed the State Government had been considering taking legal action against the builders of the Adelaide Convention Centre.

The ABC also revealed that the company responsible for fire engineering work on the building had discussed the possibility of recladding the building, and the effect on its reputation with the Government.

Mr Knoll said while further tests were underway, the four major public buildings were safe for public use.

""There's obviously some work going on in relation to the Convention Centre and the testing of some cladding there and also there may be some minor work being done to Adelaide Oval,"" he said.

""Having said that, the risk assessment tool says that all of these buildings are safe to use.""

Editor's note October 10, 2019: This story initially stated there were more than 30 buildings that required remedial work. The figure has been corrected to 30.

A man has been charged after the NSW Police dog unit van was rammed by a stolen car on Tuesday.

Officers in three fully-marked police cars — including a dog unit — were patrolling at Nambucca Train Station when police allege a suspected stolen Subaru entered the carpark.

The police dog car followed the Subaru when it allegedly accelerated towards the police car, ramming the driver's side door.

The officer suffered only minor injuries and the police dogs were not injured. The man alleged to be behind the wheel was arrested in Coffs Harbour yesterday and charged with a range of offences. 

Police say they have broken a major drug supply ring after discovering half a tonne of methamphetamine hidden in a shipping container. 

Police located the drugs — worth an estimated $375 million — in pallets at the Sydney Container Examination Facility last month.

Four men — aged 33, 35, 36 and 55 — were arrested yesterday and charged. 

Three of the men were refused bail to appear at Sutherland Local Court today.

Efforts are increasing today to stop 180 job losses at regional stations of Essential Energy.

Deputy Premier John Barilaro will meet the head of the state-owned corporation to try to put a stop to the cuts. 

An urgent hearing is also expected to take place this morning in the Fair Work Commission.

The Electrical Trades Union will ask Fair Work to prevent any job losses happening in the next eight weeks while negotiations with Essential Energy continue.

The Blacktown City Council has agreed to launch a five-month trial of organic alternatives to Roundup after more than 500 employees stopped work yesterday.

The council workers downed tools over safety concerns with the glyphosate weedkiller, which has been linked to cancer.

Blacktown will now be the fifth-largest council to phase out the glyphosate sprays following decisions by Fairfield, Randwick, Georges River and Wollongong councils to trial alternatives.

An inquiry into the regulation of building standards, building quality and building disputes has commenced in the NSW Upper House.

The role of private certification in protecting building standards and the adequacy of consumer protections for owners and purchasers of new buildings will be examined.

The public accountability committee will focus on case studies related to flammable cladding on NSW buildings and the defects discovered in Mascot Towers and the Opal Tower.

Instead, Commissioner Richard Beasley SC said the inquiry into misconduct allegations would explore the council's handling of the development, headed by Auburn councillor Ronney Oueick's company, BBC Development.

Insurer AIG has refused to foot the repair bill, claiming the roof of the building contained structural defects.

It said the storm was not the cause of the damage.

But on the fourth day of the Auburn Council inquiry, Commissioner Beasley said exactly what caused the damage was outside of the terms of reference.

""The inquiry cannot enquire into whether the roof came off because of any alleged breaches of the Australian Building Act,"" he said.

He said it would instead focus on the council's dealings with the development.

""What is relevant to the inquiry is what members of council staff may or may not have done,"" he said.

Local Government Minister Paul Toole suspended Auburn City Council earlier this year and announced a public inquiry to investigate claims that councillors were misusing their positions.

He said there were concerns some councillors may have been using their positions to obtain significant planning outcomes for themselves, relatives and council colleagues.

Earlier this month, Auburn City Council was absorbed by the newly created Parramatta and Cumberland councils, which were formed under the State Government's amalgamation program earlier this month.

Controversial former Auburn City Council deputy mayor Salim Mehajer will be called to give evidence at the inquiry.

It will look at the council's response to the street closure for Mr Mehajer's wedding at Lidcombe in western Sydney last year.

Mr Mehajer gained notoriety after the wedding and was later fined $220 by the council.

The inquiry is expected to last up to three weeks.

Perth Children's Hospital acting head of commissioning Professor Frank Daly told Fairfax Media about 1,500 of the 3,000 panels had been damaged in transit before being installed.

He said the problem had been detected about 18 months ago, after the panels had already been put up.

""The quality assurance process that determined there was a small amount of damage ... wasn't done until afterwards,"" he said.

""These panels provide protection for sunlight from the building but they're not part of the water proofing or the air proofing of the building.""

He said the contractor was responsible for the cost of replacing the panels.

""There is no cost to the state whatsoever,"" he said.

Professor Daly said the problem would not delay the opening of the $1.2 billion hospital, which is already well behind schedule. 

""It doesn't delay us at all,"" he said.

""That's why it hasn't been an issue for me personally because it doesn't have any bearing on our program.""

He said the 1,500 panels would be replaced over an extended period of time, probably not until the hospital was open.

Opposition health spokesman Roger Cook said he was astonished the Government had known about the problem for so long.

""It's another project which the Barnett Government has failed to oversight properly, and we have these problems that keep leaking out day in day out which impact upon the capacity to actually deliver infrastructure for Western Australians,"" Mr Cook said.

""I can't see now how the Barnett Government will complete this hospital by the end of 2016.""

Premier Colin Barnett said while the problem with the panels was frustrating, any major building project was likely to experience defects.

""Anyone building a house will often experience defects,"" he said.

""But it is not at any cost to the Government or the taxpayer and won't delay the completion of the children's hospital ... Western Australia is going to have an absolutely magnificent children's hospital."" 

The hospital was originally scheduled to open late last year, but that date has been repeatedly pushed back over the past 18 months, with the facility plagued by construction problems and delays.

More than 900 door frames had to be replaced for failing to comply with Australian standards, while it was also discovered half-a-kilometre of water piping needed to be replaced.

The hospital is meant to be open by the end of the year, but during a budget estimates hearing in State Parliament last week, Health Department officials stopped short of guaranteeing the facility would be open by then.

Officials told the hearing that limited commissioning work in part of the hospital had begun, but it was still too early to say when construction would be finished.

In his opening address, counsel assisting the commissioner Paul Bolster said the inquiry would look at the council's response to the street closure for Mr Mehajer's wedding at Lidcombe in western Sydney last year.

Mr Mehajer gained notoriety after the wedding and was later fined $220 by the council.

The inquiry has heard that in 2014, Auburn councillors used colouring pencils to show how they wanted to rezone the Berala Village Centre, which included property owned by one of the councillors, Hicham Zraika.

The changes benefitted Mr Zraika, and Mr Bolster said that would be a focus of the inquiry.

Mr Bolster said the inquiry would also examine the circumstances surrounding several planning proposals and building developments, including why the council failed to address alleged misconduct by councillor and developer Ronney Oueik.

The Liberal councillor developed an Auburn unit block where apartments approved for two bedrooms were converted into three-bedroom units.

Developer contributions are partly calculated by the number of bedrooms in an apartment.

""How that came about and why nothing was done about it ... is a a matter of interest to the inquiry,"" Mr Bolster said. 

The council received legal advice in 2008 and was told to prosecute the building developers for breaches to regulations.

However, it was not until the council was suspended earlier this year, and placed into the control of administrator Viv May, that any legal action was launched. 

Mr Bolster said people were now living in residences that did not comply with regulations and that the council had been forced to absorb additional costs rather than pass them onto ratepayers.

The NSW Labor leader and member for Auburn, Luke Foley, said outside the hearing the public inquiry should also focus on a Lidcombe apartment block, developed by Mr Oueik, that lost its roof in a storm earlier this year.

Insurer AIG refused to foot the repair bill and claimed the roof of the building contained structural defects and the storm was not the cause of the damage.

""The insurers says it was riddled with structural defects - never should have been certified,"" Mr Foley said outside the hearing today.

""The council Mr Oueik sat on certified the building. This case is just crying out for examination by this public inquiry.""

Terry Jeon, a resident from the unit block that lost its roof said he was ""really shocked"" when it happened.

""[It was] really, really stressful ... you can't forget these things,"" Mr Jeon said.

""I still need to pay my mortgage every week and now I need to pay rent to live somewhere else.""

The inquiry heard Mr Oueik also allegedly organised free renovations for former council staff member Glenn Francis.

Mr Francis did not disclose the renovations, which he claims Mr Oueik described as a ""gift"" until 2016. He is due to give evidence this week.

Local Government Minister Paul Toole suspended Auburn City Council earlier this year and announced a public inquiry to investigate claims that councillors were misusing their positions.

He said there were concerns some councillors may have been using their positions to obtain significant planning outcomes for themselves, relatives and council colleagues.

Former councillor Irene Simms spent years trying to draw attention to problems with developers on the council, but said it took media headlines around flashy Mr Mehajer to finally get authorities to listen.

He was suspended from the council in January by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which found he breached pecuniary interest laws by failing to disclose his financial interest in a council vote.

However, that decision was overturned on appeal.

""In some ways, I have Salim to thank for this [inquiry],"" Ms Simms said.

""I think it is the antics of Salim - mostly, to be honest, outside the council, not inside the council - that has brought so much attention.""

A Japanese maker of seismic dampeners — used to reduce the impacts of earthquakes — has been found to have falsified inspection data for more than a decade.

Its products are in more than 1,000 buildings across Japan, including high-rise buildings and hospitals.

The Japanese Government says buildings using the defective products are not at risk of collapsing in strong earthquakes — just that they could sway more than expected.

Professor Hiroshi Kawase from the University of Kyoto's Disaster Prevention Research Institute told the ABC that the dampers only activated after a building had absorbed the peak impact of a quake.

He said they were a secondary countermeasure to reduce the sway after a quake hit buildings.

""A damper cannot reduce the peak amount of the building vibration — but it reduces the duration of shaking,"" he said.

""Without a damper, the building shakes for a long time — especially for high-rise building, it can last minutes. But if we have a damper then the shaking will reduce to maybe a third of the duration.""

Tokyo-based KYB and its subsidiary, Kayaba System Machinery, manufactured and sold the defective dampers from March of 2000 through to September of this year. 

The products did not meet the standards set by the government.

The Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism said the company falsified the pre-sale test results of their dampers and ordered them to be replaced immediately.

KYB's President Yasusuke Nakajima said he was ""very sorry"" for the scandal.

""We deeply apologise from our hearts for causing enormous concern and trouble to the related people such as the owners, residents, construction companies and design offices,"" he said.

""Our company's basic policy is to immediately replace the nonconforming products and continue the investigation into products where it is unclear if they have been altered or not.""

It's understood at least eight inspectors were found to have been involved in altering the data.

KYB has been informing affected building owners over the last few days, and subject to their approval, will name them today.

The operator of Tokyo's famous Skytree said it uses a KYB system for absorption and control and is investigating whether more devices made by the company are used at the tower.

A hospital in Miyagi Prefecture was found to contain the faulty dampers — visitors said they were concerned.

KYB products are also in the Olympic Aquatics Centre and other Tokyo 2020 venues.

A spokesperson for the Tokyo 2020 Games told the ABC it was aware of the issue and that it was awaiting the results of an investigation.

Professor Kawase said people living in buildings with the defective products should not be overly concerned, as the difference between a product that performed to 80 per cent of the required standard and one that passed would be unlikely to be felt by residents.

In 2015, a similar data fabrication scandal involving Toyo Tire & Rubber Co affected 154 buildings that had installed the company's earthquake shock absorbers.

The NSW Nurses Association says the Batlow Multi Purpose Service which opened in August still has loose wires, missing wall panels, a hole in an office roof, and dangerous water leaks.

The union says it is seeking an urgent Workcover inspection next week.

In the meantime patients needing admission will be transferred to hospitals in Tumut or Wagga Wagga.

The Greater Southern Area Health Service says contractors are fixing the problems.

Susan Pearce from the Nurses Association says members have not taken the action suddenly or lightly.

""The Health Service has an absolute obligation to its staff to ensure that they are safe at work,"" she said.

""That legislation overrides pretty much everything that's out there, and it extends to the patients as well.""

Nearly two years on it's still not finished and they've spent an extra $150,000 fixing defects and $50,000 on legal fees.

The couple, who are approaching retirement, describe it as the most traumatic experience of their life.

""It's been really tough, my wife lost 10 kilos, I don't know how much I lost but she lost 10 kilos of weight, regularly in tears, the stress levels were unbelievable,"" Adriane Creamer said.

Issues with their build surfaced four months in when Mr Creamer said he realised his cladding had been installed incorrectly.

Then other tradesmen — the tiler and kitchen joiner — started raising concerns with the couple about new walls being not completely vertical and the floor not being level.

""The kitchen there was 30 millimetres lower on one side of the room than it is on the other side of the room, there were issues with the deck, it wasn't fixed to the main building properly,"" Mr Creamer said.

When he questioned the builder about the issues, the couple said the relationship became so strained, they sought legal advice and an assessment from a second building surveyor.

""We had a building surveyor who was heartily recommended by our builder, but the problem with that was, he basically didn't see anything [wrong],"" Mr Creamer said.

The second surveyor's report listed a number of problems.

""He [the builder] got about 30 things wrong with the build, 30 defects, 12 of which were so serious we couldn't live in the house or sell the house until they were satisfactorily repaired,"" Mr Creamer said.

The relevant regulator in Tasmania, the Consumer, Building and Occupation Services (CBOS), insists there are sufficient consumer protections to force builders to fix defects, without resorting to legal action.

In a statement, a spokesman said during construction, the building surveyor can issue direction notices to require rectification of defects. 

""If a builder fails to comply, the permit authority of the relevant council has powers to enforce compliance,"" the spokesman said.

If defects are discovered after practical completion, CBOS said it had a range of dispute resolution processes, including adjudication.

""And an adjudication outcome made by a panel, has the effect of an order of the Magistrates Court,"" the spokesman said.

The Creamers, who were desperate to move into their home, were worried this process could drag on for many months, if not years, and did not trust their builder to properly repair the work.

Acting on the advice of their experienced property lawyer, they terminated their building contract and have paid other tradesmen to repair the defects.

Labor MP Jen Butler said she is regularly contacted about dodgy builders and Tasmanians were being left hundreds of thousands of dollars out of pocket.

""We think it's time for us as a parliament to have a look to the future of the industry in Tasmania and how we can better protect consumers and how we can better protect our building industry,"" Ms Butler said.

She will table a motion in Parliament on Thursday for a select committee inquiry on consumer and building sector protections in the Tasmanian building and construction industry.

""Consumers are repeatedly facing issues with problem builders with very little recourse except taking really expensive legal action and a lot of the time the consumers have already invested just about everything that they've got into the build,"" Ms Butler said. 

""A lot of the time the legal action isn't in their favour and it takes an awful long time for it to be resolved,"" she said.

She said the proposed inquiry would examine the adequacy of current legislative and regulatory mechanisms available to CBOS to investigate and compel builders to fix defective work. ""Tasmania's building and construction industry is booming … from time to time there are shonky builders and we want to see how we best protect the quality reputation that Tasmanian builders have,"" Ms Butler said.

""So many builders are really frustrated, because when you have shonky building practices it undermines the reputation of the whole industry.""

The Creamers are backing calls for a parliamentary inquiry but in the meantime have taken matters into their own hands.

They have erected signs on their front lawn to raise awareness about their experience and are urging people to know their rights.

 ""We're going to try to do what we can to change what needs to be changed in Tasmania to make it a level playing field.""

The Minister for Consumer Affairs, Elise Archer, has already rejected the idea of a parliamentary inquiry, even before the terms of reference have been tabled in Parliament.

She said she understood the concerns raised by several individuals interviewed by the ABC last month and she met with them recently to discuss a way forward.

She said many of their issues related to legislation that had since been strengthened.

""While many of the issues raised relate to circumstances before our amendments, I have asked my department to look at any potential improvements that could be made to further strengthen the framework moving forward,"" Ms Archer said.

""Therefore, there is no need for a parliamentary inquiry,"" she said.

She said a new tribunal would commence in November called the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (TasCAT).

""I am already considering whether TasCAT could handle disputes around these issues into the future to make it simpler, faster and cheaper to resolve such disputes,"" Ms Archer said.

It has angered some consumers, like Launceston homeowner Ash Dunn, who said it appeared the meeting with Elise Archer and CBOS a few weeks ago had been a waste of time.

""We need an inquiry for the sake of transparency and to get to the bottom of things.""

Free parking is to be provided for NSW Health staff at public hospital car parks to help support them during the pandemic.

It's a temporary measure while the current restrictions are in place and will start in the next NSW Health pay cycle.

It comes after the Health Services Union called for free parking in and around major Sydney hospitals for essential workers struggling to get to their jobs.

NSW Health deputy secretary Phil Minns said relevant local councils would also be asked to waive parking fines around hospital and vaccination facilities for healthcare workers during the lockdown.

""We hope this action brings some peace of mind to all our health staff at this challenging time,"" Mr Minns said.

Fragments of COVID-19 have been found in Byron Bay's wastewater in the state's north. The sewage treatment plant serves about 19,000 people in Byron Bay, Wategos, Suffolk Park, Sunrise, and Broken Head. NSW Health said the finding was of great concern as there were no known cases in the area.  People are being urged to be especially vigilant for symptoms, get tested and isolate if needed. 

NSW Health has been forced to quash social media rumours that supermarkets across Sydney will close next week due to growing COVID-19 cases.

In a statement issued late last night NSW Health said it was aware of reports that supermarkets would close for four days.

""NSW Health can confirm this is not the case, and reminds people to only use trusted and credible sources for information on COVID-19,"" the statement said.

It comes after a warning from health authorities and Premier Gladys Berejiklian for people to limit their shopping after a growing number of supermarkets and ""essential retail"" shops were added to the list of COVID-19 exposure sites.

The developers behind Sydney’s Opal Tower have been ordered to fix more problems with the residential skyscraper.

The rectification orders, issued by the Office of the NSW Building Commissioner, relate to defective aluminium sunshades which “could fall from the façade and cause harm to the building occupants”.

Government inspectors also recently found some fire doors are failing to self-close due to “negative air pressure created by excessive air movement through the lobby”.

Developers Icon, Australia Avenue Developments and the Sydney Olympic Park Authority have been ordered to submit a plan to reftify the issues within 42 days.

The tower was evacuated on Christmas Eve in 2018 over fears the building would collapse after large cracks appeared.

It sparked costly rectification work and years of legal action including a dispute between Icon and its insurers.

Premier Gladys Berejiklian has warned the state to expect higher numbers of COVID-19 cases after a record number of people were in the community while infectious.

NSW recorded 124 new COVID-19 cases yesterday — the worst day so far of the current Delta variant outbreak.

There were 48 cases infectious while in the community, with another 22 people infectious for part of the time.

The border with Queensland is now closed to the entire state and border zone residents can only cross over for essential reasons.

An update to the Public Health Orders comes into effect today, stipulating that anyone exempt from wearing a mask must carry proof.

Some cockatoos have learned how to open wheelie bin lids by observing each other, a scientific paper has confirmed. 

The research, published in the journal Science, began after footage emerged of a cockatoo opening a bin on the street with its beak and claws.

Taronga Conservation Society's John Martin said the paper confirmed the birds were learning from one another.

""They've been observing each other and we've shown that they've been socially learning,"" Dr Martin said.

Citizen scientist Suzie Roessel said she had observed cockatoos learning behaviours. 

""A few I've trained to do footsies, they'll grab my finger with their foot, she said.

""There's new birds that arrive now and they're much faster to train after they've seen the other ones doing it.""

The 22-storey twin Imperial Tower complex on Hassall Street in Parramatta was on Wednesday hit with a prohibition order banning residents, after the NSW Building Commissioner David Chandler highlighted major issues with waterproofing, the ""load-bearing component"" of the building, and fire safety.

Many of the 179 apartments have been sold off the plan, and owners and tenants had been set to begin moving in, before the order was issued.

The order stated government inspectors documented a range of problems in the twin buildings, including waterproofing issues, non-compliant structural steel junctions in the basement, and inadequate fire safety systems that heightened the risk of fire spreading throughout the complex.

It also found drainage and ventilation issues with the cladding at the base of the walls and at the window and door openings.

Commissioner Chandler said the rectification works needed to be urgently addressed and ordered the developer to rectify the problems.

""I am satisfied that a serious defect in the building exists,"" Mr Chandler said in the order. 

The order also prevents the registration of a strata plan.

Developer, Hassall Developments, directed by Abbass Elzein, was issued the order this week.

The ABC attempted to contact Mr Elzein through the company's registered address, listed as Punchbowl-based accounting firm.    

In advertising material, the building is promoted as a  ""dramatic architectural statement"" showcasing ""flawless design and superior craftsmanship"" with apartments starting about $500,000. 

It comes just weeks after the Commissioner issued a similar order for the Skyview apartment complex in Castle Hill, by developer Toplace, after extensive signs of cracking"" were discovered in its basement.

2021-10-28,ABC,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-06-29/opal-tower-owners-launch-supreme-court-case-over-new-defects/12402444,2020-06-29,Opal Tower unit owners launch Supreme Court case after 500 new defects discovered - ABC News,"Owners of units in Sydney's Opal Tower have launched legal action against the NSW Government after discovering more than 500 new defects in the beleaguered building.

They are also suing the NSW Government in a separate class action

The owners' corporation launched the proceedings in the NSW Supreme Court against the Sydney Olympic Park Authority (SOPA) — a NSW Government entity — and the builder Icon

The tower was evacuated on Christmas Eve 2018 when cracks started to appear in the building.

The owners' corporation claimed it had found more defects in the building and wanted SOPA held to account.

""We've been kept in the dark, as they've strung us along thinking its only the major defect you saw well publicised, but I can tell you there are over 500 other defects we were not aware of that have now come to light,"" owners' corporation chairman Shady Eskander said. 

Mr Eskander said these defects were found by independent experts hired by the owners' corporation to inspect the building.

He said the insurance premium for the whole building this year came to more than $1 million — up from $100,000 in 2018.

This lawsuit is separate to a class action which was launched a year ago.

Mr Eskander said the owners were suing for the cost of fixing all defects in common areas, building inspections, project managers, insurance and legal fees. 

Some residents who had been out of their apartments for seven months moved back into Opal Tower in August last year, but Mr Eskander said living in the building was not easy.

""It's very difficult to put into words, our homes are our greatest asset, it's where we make lasting memories,"" Mr Eskander said. 

""We've had to deal with over 100 construction workers on the site, drilling noise all day … sometimes we've found we only have one lift working and we have to wait 10 minutes.""

Mr Eskander said people had experienced difficulty with banks as a result of owning property in the well-known building.

""You say you own a property in Opal Tower, that property was worth $500,000 [or] $700,000 … the bank puts a zero against your name, you can't refinance, you can't get a small loan to buy a car.""

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said today she wasn't aware of the new lawsuit, but said the Government was working to support the affected residents.

""We certainly have been there doing what we can and recently not only have we appointed a building commissioner but put through new legislation to protect owners into the future so certainly we appreciate the angst they're going through and we'll continue to support them in whichever way feels appropriate,"" Ms Berejiklian said. 

Apartment owner Andrew Neverly said he had bought the unit as part of his retirement plan, but now it's worth nothing and he had to let his previous tenants break their lease. 

""They had to move out they didn't feel safe, that was just weeks after the evacuation,"" he said.

""We've been fortunate in finding another tenant.

""It's emotionally been a real rollercoaster, when we bought into this we thought we were buying into the Australian dream.""

A spokesperson for Icon said it had spent $40 million on remediation since the 2018 evacuation and were providing a 20-year structural warranty on 'rectification work' at the Opal Tower. 

""Despite weekly meetings with the Opal Tower Owners Corporation, we only became aware of the overwhelming majority of recently identified alleged issues when legal action was launched,"" the spokesperson said. 

""Icon remains ready to address any actual defects in Opal Tower as a priority and has asked the Owners Corporation for access to the building to identify any legitimate defects. 

""While this permission has been denied to date, Icon will continue to address legitimate issues within apartments that are not the property of the Owners Corporation and has written to directly to individual apartment owners to obtain access.""

A SOPA spokesperson declined to comment while the matter was before the court.

2021-10-28,ABC,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-05/apartments-could-prove-the-crack-in-the-housing-market-recovery/11478834,2019-09-04,Apartments could be the crack in the housing market recovery - ABC News,"Spring is more than floral blooms, football finals and trying to find where you stored your thongs — for house-hunters it represents a strong opportunity to buy a home.

The popular season for owners attempting to sell means an increased volume of stock available, but there may be a crack in the market.

Structural defects in high-rise apartment blocks — including cracking in Sydney's Opal Tower and flammable cladding, raising fire risks on others around the nation — have forced the evacuation of residents and triggered awareness about loopholes letting down owners and renters.

With no simple solution in sight and the issue traversing the responsibility of state and federal governments, insurers, surveyors and builders, analysts are weighing the impact.

""This could be many billions, even a trillion dollars, worth of damage if you take the value collapse as well actually cost of repair,"" said Digital Finance Analytics principal Martin North.

""We need to understand that this is going to be a very important issue over a long period of time.

""Many thousands of buildings are impacted,  not only of course those being currently built,  and there were 270,000 to 300,000 [units] now, but also those that were sold over the last 20 years.""

Industry figures are warning of another problem attached to the publicity — owners aware of structural defects in their buildings are less likely to seek publicity to force the issues to be fixed, because it will cause a collapse in the value of their investment. 

This means the full impact of the crisis is unlikely to be known for some time.

While Australia is made up of many different housing markets driven by different conditions, national house prices were on a rocket rise before peaking around two years ago, and then slipping. 

Now, the slide might be over — the price of homes in capital cities lifted an average of 1 per cent in August, according to real estate data firm CoreLogic, boosted by a 1.6 per cent jump in Sydney and a 1.4 per cent rise in Melbourne. 

Prices in five of the eight state and territory capitals went up, although Darwin (-1.2 per cent), Perth (-0.5 per cent) and Adelaide (-0.2 per cent) prices continued to fall.

""It does look like the downturn is turning the other way,"" said CoreLogic's head of Australian research Cameron Kusher.

However, he added a note of caution — the figures are only one month's worth and people should not get ""carried away"" by the turnaround.

""I wouldn't expect we're going to continue to see a 1.6 per cent increase each month going forward, but I do expect we are going to see values increase,"" he said.

While apartments appear to have had smaller price falls than houses, CoreLogic's figures do not fully pick up falls in the value of off-the-plan apartments.

Australian Bureau of Statistics figures from July show what could be impact of some of the scandals, as well as an oversupply of units — building approvals for new homes fell 3.3 per cent, but approvals of other dwellings, including apartments, were down a steeper 18.4 per cent in the month and 44 per cent over the year.

""We're going to see, I think, a significant loss of demand in the high-rise sector specifically,"" said Digital Finance Analytics' Martin North.

""We know that more people are now not wanting to 'complete' on high rise buildings that they actually committed to buy off-the-plan.

""Those rates of default have doubled compared to where they were … in some [areas] property values in the unit sector are down 30 per cent now from where they were and we know there's more ahead.""

There have been some positive developments for the property market in recent months, however — the Reserve Bank has cut its cash rate twice, which can flow through to mortgage rates, and more cuts are expected.

Meanwhile, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has lowered the buffer used to stress test loans. 

Previously, banks has to assess whether borrowers could service a mortgage if interest rates jumped above 7 per cent. That level has now been lowered to within 2 or 2.5 per cent above the current rate, meaning people can borrow more. 

Property Council of Victoria executive director Cressida Wall stressed the need for buyers to exercise diligence when purchasing properties, but denied the scandals were hampering the apartment market.

""Overall, the clearance rates for apartments have been rising since November last year and, while there may be individual circumstances, the majority of buyers factor this in as one of the considerations that they have when making one of the biggest purchases of their life,"" she said.

Contributing to the reputational damage is a loss of confidence in those approving projects.

For example, in 17 years as a building surveyor, Kamran Zand Basiri approved almost 6,000 houses and flats — with a peak of up to 800 a year according to court documents.

The Victorian Building Authority has spent years prosecuting him and suspended his license under new powers last month. Mr Basiri is fighting the suspension.

The Property Council is calling for a national solution.

""The majority of buildings in Australia are safe and we have some of the best regulation in the world,"" Ms Wall said.

""What's required is a national approach to make sure that safety is maintained and enhanced. 

""The time to act is now there are people buying houses and apartments every weekend and there needs to be swift action from all governments on this issue.""

However, Martin North does not see any quick solutions for apartment sellers, or buyers, with no government or industry group wanting to pick up the bill.

""I think this is going to be one of the biggest most critical issues for the economy over the next couple years. The high-rise sector is in for a very bumpy ride for a long period of time,"" he said.

And he offered some advice for would-be buyers.

""If you want to buy unit, buy an old one — 20, 30, 40 years old. Don't buy a new one.""

2021-10-28,ABC,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-17/mum-son-lived-in-rental-house-contaminated-with-mould-for-years/9254710,2017-12-16,Doctor had to plead for boy with lung problems to be moved out of mouldy rental house - ABC News,"Jemima Balhas and her young son lived in a rental home with a serious mould problem for seven years, despite pleas from their doctor for them to be rehoused.

She is now fighting for compensation after losing all her belongings due to the risk of contamination.

Lawyers said the case highlighted the need for minimum standards for rental properties to protect people's health and safety.

Ms Balhas said she first noticed mould spots in 2011, six months after she moved in.

She said a contractor, who came to the house when she reported the problem to Aboriginal Housing Victoria, told her it was due to her weight and was condensation due to heavy breathing.

Eighteen months later, she said the mould had started to grow on her baby son's bassinette.

""[It had] dots like someone had gone to it with a marker. It was pretty shocking,"" Ms Balhas told the ABC.

She said repeated complaints led to a few repairs, but the flaking walls, mould patches, and water stains kept returning.

""I would clean it away, I tried everything, but it would come back thicker,"" she said.

Her now five-year-old son Tobias has asthma and bronchiolitis, and when his health deteriorated this year, she got legal advice.

""Him breathing in the air is making his little lungs weaker,"" Ms Balhas said. ""It's not fair on him.""

Last month, lawyers acting on Ms Balhas's behalf took the matter to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal.

A mould inspection ordered by the tribunal uncovered some inside walls had up to 90 per cent moisture levels — well exceeding the allowable limit of 15 per cent.

The cause was identified as lack of waterproofing in the shower, a possible roof leak and a broken exhaust fan. 

""This property is seriously contaminated and not habitable,"" the report stated.

""No-one should enter this property [until] a clearance certificate is provided.""

Ms Balhas and her son are now staying in temporary housing at a caravan park in Bairnsdale, in Victoria's east.

Tobias's Christmas and birthday presents remain at the house with all their belongings, due to contamination fears.

Dr Jane Greacen said the mouldy conditions left Tobias in danger of developing a fungal pneumonia.

Since 2013, she has written three separate letters to Aboriginal Housing Victoria stating the health risks the mould posed to the boy.

In September, Dr Greacen wrote it was a matter of urgency he be removed from the house.

""Tobias's asthma with his history of bronchiolitis is being aggravated by living in this house,"" Dr Greacen wrote.

""The house is full of mould … it is clearly unsafe for any person living in it.""

Aboriginal Housing Victoria said it did provide a range of assistance to Ms Balhas, including applying a mould treatment, repainting, and the servicing of a heater.

However, AHV said more recently the mould problem had escalated and Ms Balhas and her son would be rehoused. AHV is now investigating the cause of the problem.

""Aboriginal Housing Victoria will pay for the removal and cleaning costs for the furnishings that can be restored,"" director of strategy and performance John Templeman told the ABC.

The housing body has offered her $1,000 to replace her soft furnishings and will remediate her electrical appliances.

""These commitments are made on the assumption that the damage caused to the building are a result of structural defects in the building and not related to any tenant related damage or neglect,"" Mr Templeman said.

""There are a number of claims in the ABC story that AHV cannot verify, such as the claim that letters from Jemima's doctor were ignored. AHV has no evidence that this occurred.""

The Housing Officer Manager at the housing organisation will now ensure Ms Balhas is properly signed up to a new rental property.

Microbiologist Dr Cameron Jones said mould in buildings was a widespread problem and the serious health risks were not being recognised.

""The first signs of water damage or mould need to be gotten on top of quickly. Mould will quickly grow on any building product that contains a carbon source or a food source,"" Dr Jones said.

Dr Jones said dangerous situations arise when the mould was growing unseen in a wall or ceiling, becoming ""a toxic hazard"".

Mould can cause respiratory risks in people with asthma or allergies, and long-term health impacts can include chronic inflammatory syndromes in people with poor immune systems.

The ABC showed Dr Jones photographs from inside Ms Balhas's rental, along with the recent mould report.

""I would be very concerned not just because of the spores that are in the indoor air but from the viable mould, the whole home would be a toxic hazard,"" he said.

""It's negligence permitting anyone to remain in a home with such obvious visible defects.""

He also doesn't believe the level of water damage could have been caused by the tenant.

""This is years of damage,"" he said.

Joel Townsend from Victoria Legal Aid said one of the most common complaints from tenants was about mould, and the default position of most landlords was to blame the tenant.

He said Ms Balhas's case pointed to the need for minimum standards in all states and territories, to ensure buildings have proper ventilation and are structurally sound. 

Currently, specific minimum standards for rentals exist in only Tasmania and South Australia.

""We are not talking about providing the Taj Mahal. We are talking about providing tenants with that basic minimum set of standards so they can enjoy their property without worrying about the risk to their health and safety,"" Mr Townsend said.

""The international experience and so far in Tasmania and South Australia is that it doesn't reduce housing stock and it doesn't drive up rent.""

Ms Balhas is expected to be rehoused five days before Christmas.

Editor's note December 19, 2017: This story initially reported that an AHV housing officer made the statements about Ms Balhas' weight. However, documents tendered at VCAT state the comments were made by a contractor sent to the house by AHV.

The up-beat promotion of ""the swing to urban living"" by one of Australia's leading developer lobby groups epitomises the rhetoric around this seismic shift in housing.

Glossy advertisements for luxury living in our city centres and suburbs adorn the property pages of our newspapers.

Brochures boast of breathtaking city views from uppers storeys and gush about amenity, lifestyle and ""liveability"" — often touting the benefits of adjacent public infrastructure investments (but please don't mention ""value sharing"").

Depictions of attractive younger people, occasionally clutching a smiling infant, are prominent as the image of all things new, urban and desirable.

Long gone are the days when the manifestations of property marketeers' imaginations were restricted to images of low-density, master-planned estates on the urban fringe. We hardly ever hear about these nowadays.

There's truth in the claims that housing choice and diversity have indeed widened in the past few decades as a result.

The statistics clearly show a much greater spread of dwelling options in our cities.

Apartments now account for 28 per cent of housing in Sydney and 15 per cent in Melbourne.

As the maps below show, most recent growth in apartment stock is clearly in and around the inner city. Yet even the more distant suburbs have had an increase in higher-density residential development.

For many, inner-city apartment living is clearly a preferred choice for the stage in their life when an upcoming, ""vibrant"" neighbourhood is attractive.

High-density urban renewal has been a boon for hipsters and students alike.

But the issue of choice needs to be unpacked carefully. For many others, the ""swing to urban living"" is more of a necessity.

True, the surge in apartment building has put many properties onto the market to rent or buy that are clearly cheaper than houses in the same suburb. From that point of view, they have added to the affordability of these neighbourhoods.

However, affordable to whom is an open question. At $850,000 and upwards for a standard two-bedder in Waterloo, South Sydney, and $500,000 or more in Melbourne's Docklands for a similar property, these are not exactly a cheap option for anyone on a low income.

But other than in the prestige areas where higher-income downsizers and pied-à-terre owners can be enticed to buy in some comfort, much of what is being built is straightforward ""investor-grade product"" — flats built to attract the burgeoning investment market.

It can be argued the investor has always been a major target of apartment developers, even in the 1960s and 1970s when strata units became common, particularly in Sydney. But it is even more so today.

Despite the clamour to control overseas investors perceived to be flooding the market, the bulk of investors are home grown.

We don't need to rehearse the debates on the factors that have fuelled this splurge, but clearly the development industry has been savvy to the possibilities of this market.

In the past decade, backed by state planning authorities and politicians desperate to claim they have ""solved"" housing affordability by letting apartment building rip, developers have got involved on an unprecedented scale.

The figures bear this out: in 2016, for the first time, Australia built more apartments than houses. The majority end up for rent.

In the rush, we, the housing consumer, have been offered a motley range of new housing with a series of escalating problems.

Leaving aside amateur management by owners' bodies in charge of multi-million-dollar assets, problems of short-term holiday lettings and neighbour disputes, there are more serious concerns over build quality, defective materials and fire compliance.

The apartment market has been left wide open for poor-quality outcomes by building industry deregulation. This includes:

Plus there's the rush to get buildings up and sold off.

Not to mention fly-by-night ""phoenix"" developers who vanish as soon as the last flat is occupied, never to be found when the defects bills come in.

The lack of consumer protection in this market is astounding. The average toaster comes with more consumer protection — at least you can get your money back if the product fails.

These chickens will surely come home to roost in the lower end of the market, which will never attract the wealthy empty-nesters or cashed-up young professionals with the resources to ensure quality outcomes.

In Melbourne, space and design standards, including windowless bedrooms, have come under critical scrutiny, as has site cramming.

Tall apartment blocks stand cheek-by-jowl in overdeveloped inner-city precincts.

At least New South Wales has State Environmental Planning Policy 65, which regulates space and amenity standards, and the BASIX environmental standard to prevent the more egregious practices.

But people are most likely to confront the problems of density in the many thousands of new units adorning precincts around suburban rail stations and town centres.

These have been built under the uncertain logic of ""transport-orientated development"", often replacing light industrial or secondary commercial development.

These developments attract a mixed community of lower-income renters. Many are recently arrived immigrants and marginal home buyers — often first-timers.

Many have young children, as these units are the only option for young families to buy or rent in otherwise-unaffordable markets. Overall, though, renters predominate.

What will be the trajectory of these blocks, once the gloss wears off and those who can move on do so?

You only have to look at the previous generation of suburban walk-up blocks in these areas to find the answer.

Far from bastions of gentrification, the large multi-unit buildings in less-prestigious locations will drift inexorably into the lower reaches of the private rental market.

Town centres like Liverpool, Fairfield, Auburn, Bankstown and Blacktown in Sydney point the way.

The cracks in the density juggernaut are already showing in many of the more-recently built blocks in these areas — literally, in many cases.

This inexorable logic of the market will create suburban concentrations of lower-income households on a scale hitherto experienced only in the legacy inner-city high-rise public housing estates.

With the latter being systematically cleared away, the formation of vertical slums of the future owned by the massed ranks of unaccountable, profit-driven investor landlords is a racing certainty.

The consequences are all too easy to imagine.

The call for greater regulation of apartment, planning, design and construction is being heard in some quarters.

The 2015 NSW Independent Review of the Building Professionals Act highlights these concerns.

But don't hold your breath for rapid reform.

No-one wants to kill the goose that's laying so many golden eggs for the development industry and government alike — especially in inflated stamp-duty receipts.

The market has a habit of self-regulating on supply. Evidence of a marked downturn in apartment building is a clear sign of that.

But don't expect the market to self-regulate on quality, at least with the current highly fragmented, confusing (not least to builders and bureaucrats), under-resourced and largely unpoliced regulatory system.

The legacy of this entirely avoidable crisis is completely predictable, but will be for future generations to pick up.

Complaints about building work have doubled over the past six years in the ACT and the cost of rectification work has been estimated at $150 million a year.

The Government has released a discussion paper that includes options such as the introduction of design inspectors for apartments and other high risk projects, changes to the licensing system for builders and certifiers and changes to residential building contracts.

The discussion paper noted that defects occurred across building classifications and included water ingress, structural issues, inadequate fire protection, faulty emergency systems, inadequate emergency exits and poor ventilation.

""A lot of [the problem] is to do with architectural design,"" Planning Minister Mick Gentleman told 666 ABC Canberra.

""So when you talk about apartments a lot of the complaints relate to water ingress in apartments.

""You see designers wanting to build level outputs for patios for example or balconies and there is no step up for the door from the balcony to the apartment.

""Therefore you need the appropriate water safeguards there and those haven't been installed correctly in many cases.""

Mr Gentleman said warranty provisions in the ACT were not in line with other parts of Australia.

He said builders currently did not have to provide a warranty for work in medium and high rise apartment blocks. 

""That's why we need to fix it,"" he said.

""That's the important part of this review - to give more powers to the Government to ensure these apartments and constructions are appropriate."" 

Mr Gentleman said changes were needed to ensure the correct payments were made to subcontractors.

""Sometimes the subcontractors ... are carrying the load for larger builders in the financial sense and we want to make sure that they're paid appropriately as well,"" he said. 

The review also found existing methods for resolving building disputes could be long, costly and ineffective and suggested potential changes to the process.

It said the effect of insolvencies and bankruptcies was increasing in the construction industry and creditors were owed tens of millions of dollars each year.

The Government said it would seek comments on the discussion paper until February 12.

Student Connie Zhang, 21, jumped or fell to her death from a burning fifth-floor apartment in Bankstown.

She and her friend, Ginger Jiang, were forced onto a narrow ledge outside the apartment window, and Ms Jiang was seriously injured when she jumped for her life.

An inquest into Ms Zhang's death heard there were serious safety defects with the building.

New South Wales Fire Extinguisher Services director Narend Prasad said some of the work he certified was done by his company, but also involved other contractors.

The building was issued with separate orders by Bankstown Council and Fire and Rescue NSW to fix a series of fire safety problems.

Counsel assisting the inquest Stephen Rushton SC said there was a significant problem with water pressure on the day of the fatal fire.

The building was certified despite there being no flow pressure test on its fire hydrant system, something required annually.

Mr Prasad said he did not arrange the test because the building's strata manager had told him one had been done only a few months earlier.

No written document was provided to the inquest to support this.

Asked in general about other faults, Mr Prasad said: ""In January (2012), we did the test, everything was alright.""

One of the faults was inadequate signage for the fire sprinkler booster system.

Asked to explain how the problem could have arisen between January and April 2012, Mr Prasad said ""people tampered with it all the time"".

""Another possibility is you didn't do it,"" Mr Rushton said.

""No, we did it,"" Mr Prasad said in reply.

The complex was developed and built by Silky Constructions Pty Ltd.

The company's director, Ray Finanos, said he did not realise a louvered, polycarbonate roof installed over the building's atrium required council approval.

This alteration was blamed for a significant build-up of smoke during the fire, exposing some occupants to heat, toxicity and poor visibility as they escaped.

""I didn't think it was significant enough to warrant approval,"" Mr Finianos said.

He also denied deliberately constructing the building below 25 metres to avoid the requirement to install a sprinkler system throughout the building along with other added fire safety measures.

This saved the developer $3.7 million.

Mr Finianos said Bankstown City Council's Local Environment Plan prevented the building exceeding 25 metres.

""If it was mandatory to be done, I would have,"" he said.

The inquest has previously been told an extra bedroom was added to the apartment without authorisation.

The inquest continues.

The Owners Corporation Network held a meeting with the Fair Trading Minister Anthony Roberts yesterday to raise concerns about the increasing prevalence of defects that compromise safety.

Group Spokeswoman Karen Stiles says the Minister declined to sign a 'fairness in strata charter' that the group had prepared and which strengthened the rights of owners in dealing with issues such as warranties.

She says the fatal fire at an apartment block in Bankstown earlier this month, has shone the spotlight on the consequences of possible safety breaches.

""We're yet to find out exactly what happened in that but certainly it has been reported there had been issues of certification which has been a concern of the Owners Corporation Network for quite some time and its members, if you have a building certified to be habitable, you expect it to be habitable and safe.""

She says it is disappointing the Fair Trading Minister has refused to endorse its proposals to tackle the high number of defects in new apartment buildings.

""The Minister felt that could be seen as favouring one party over another party as far as all the interested groups in strata construction and strata living.""

One construction source said if the firewalls were found to be defective, they would likely need to be ripped out and replaced - something which would also require a substantial amount of flooring to be taken out.

The firewalls are required to be built to national standards to ensure they are capable of withstanding fire for a set amount of time.

But it is understood concerns have been raised that material within the wall could expand too quickly in case of fire, something a person involved in the construction industry described as ""deeply alarming"".

Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union state secretary Mick Buchan said the allegations were extremely concerning.

""The worst scenario is the walls will have to be replaced,"" he said.

""At the worst possible scenario that would take quite some time to repair. It would take months and months to come up with.""

Mr Buchan said the high level of inexperienced labour used on the project was a big factor in the string of problems that had plagued the project.

The latest concerns are separate to another defect that was identified with firewalls earlier in the construction process.

The hospital's opening has already been delayed by more than a year, after a string of problems including defective fire doors, asbestos-tainted roof panels and lead contamination in water.

The Health Minister and Treasurer are set to provide an update on the water issue later today, after announcing late last month a phosphate solution would be injected into pipes in a bid to finally fix the lead contamination.

In a statement, the Building Commission's director of compliance, Sandy Randall, said they had recently received information from an anonymous source questioning the compliance of firewalls at the Perth Children's Hospital.

She said Building Commission inspectors were conducting a preliminary assessment of the firewalls to establish whether there was any validity to the information received.

NSW Fair Trading issued developer Hassall Developments with a Prohibition Order in early July, demanding the company rectify a number of defects in its Imperial Towers development in Hassall Street, Parramatta.

Many buyers had paid deposits of about 10 per cent for their new apartments, up to five years ago.

While a Prohibition Order was issued by NSW Fair Trading on July 1, preventing the developer from registering a strata plan, it was replaced three weeks later with an order that did not contain that specific clause.

The change paved the way for the developer to be able to register a strata plan by the end of the month, making the contracts binding within 14 days.

Cynthia Huang paid tens of thousands of dollars in 2016 for a deposit on her dream apartment in the twin-towers development and said she was devastated when she first heard there were problems with the buildings.

""I saved for a long time for this and for my future home,"" she said.

""Those defects are about structural problems that can cause safety hazards and I can't imagine how this could happen to me.""

Ms Huang said she grew even more concerned when she saw the original Prohibition Order was re-issued, allowing the developer to register the strata plan.

""I felt protected by the initial order but when I saw the second [order] I was disappointed and stressed,"" she said.

""We as a buyer can't say no to the contract.""

Ms Huang said she was not able to terminate the contract and receive a refund for her deposit, nor could she move into her apartment as the development was not considered complete or habitable until an Occupation Certificate was issued.

""I'm so disappointed and so distressed because the new order leaves us in an extremely vulnerable situation.""

In December, Fair Trading inspectors documented a number of issues in the building, including waterproofing inadequacies, problems with the structural steel frame connections in the basement and that the building was ""not adequately protected from fire spread"".

Ben Xue also bought off the plan and said he was worried to be locked into a contract ""forever"".

""My solicitor said if they register the strata plan, I won't get out,"" he said.

""It's very hard for us to find another purchaser.""

The developer behind the project, Hassall Developments, is a subsidiary of Sydney-based Merhis Group and is in talks with the Office of the NSW Building Commissioner about fixing the defects.

Greens MP David Shoebridge, who is chairing an Upper House inquiry into the regulation of building standards, said new laws should be considered to allow buyers to exit when defects were present.

Mr Shoebridge met with around 10 Imperial Towers buyers via Zoom and said the purchase had been significant.

""For many of them, this was their first home, this was their first home in Australia as well, and they felt absolutely trapped,"" he said.

""I firmly believe the law needs to provide a better remedy for purchasers so that if they're trapped in a contract like this, there's a pathway to get out of it — to get their deposit back and get on with the rest of their life.""

Mr Shoebridge said fundamental change needed to happen, so buildings were not built with defects in the first place.

""We need quality control from day one.""

A spokesman for NSW Fair Trading said it was likely a deal would be struck with the developer — requiring the company to rectify the defects and provide a cash guarantee for any problems which may arise in the future — before the order was lifted.

A similar landmark deal was struck with developer Toplace last month over the new Skyview apartments at Castle Hill.

""Due to the nature of the defects at Hassall St, the Building Commissioner anticipates that an undertaking backed by financial guarantees may be put in place to give future owners certainty if major defects arise after they move in,"" said the spokesman. 

""When NSW Fair Trading made a ground-breaking arrangement with Toplace to guarantee the Skyview development, the Minister foreshadowed we would be prepared to enter into similar arrangements with other developers and we are not ruling anything out in this instance.""

The spokesperson said Fair Trading had examined several contracts and it appeared some owners would be eligible to rescind under the sunset clause, but some would not. 

""Matters relating to individual contracts should be discussed between the developer and the individual, who is encouraged to seek legal assistance if they are dissatisfied with the outcome,"" the spokesperson said. 

""Our focus is to ensure that developers hand over a property that is suitable for occupation.""

Hassall Developments director Abbass El-Zein told ABC News buyers would not be required to complete the purchase until an Occupation Certificate was issued.

""Once the lockdown is over and the Building Commissioner's Office can complete their inspections, we believe that all defects will have been addressed and the purchasers will not be disadvantaged,"" Mr El-Zein said. 

""All defects will be remedied by the time that final inspections are carried out post the COVID lockdown.""

He said several independent experts had been engaged and were carefully reviewing and responding to all issues.

""Apart from the current public health order delays, no purchaser will be disadvantaged,"" he said. 

""On the contrary, the Building Commissioner's involvement should give them extra comfort that their rights are protected.""

2021-10-28,ABC,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-04/nt-government-unveils-building-sector-legislation-reform/13215684,2021-03-04,NT Government unveils building legislation reforms after Darwin apartment block debacle - ABC News,"The Northern Territory government has unveiled plans to avoid a repeat of a debacle that saw more than 200 unit owners notified that their buildings had potentially significant structural defects in need of urgent and expensive rectification.

The proposed reforms, unveiled by Planning Minister Eva Lawler, would require commercial builders involved in multi-storey complexes to be registered for the first time and structural engineers to have their work verified by a third party.

""[The] majority of our builders are exceptional, they're doing some amazing work,"" Ms Lawler said.

""But there are some that aren't and that's what this is about. 

""[It is] totally unacceptable that we have had Territorians who've made large investments and haven't received a quality product.""

In 2019, the Department of Infrastructure, Planning and Logistics advised unit owners in nine multi-storey complexes in Darwin and Palmerston that their buildings were suspected of having non-compliant transfer slabs requiring urgent assessment.

Transfer slabs — which are reinforced sections of concrete that distribute floor loads onto support columns — can jeopardise the structural integrity of a building if inadequately designed. 

Last year, the NT Building Practitioners Board fined structural engineer John Scott of JWS Consultants the maximum penalty of $6,300 after finding him guilty of ""serious professional misconduct"" for defective engineering design in relation to one of the buildings.

Five of the affected buildings have since been fully rectified, while two others are in the process of being fixed.

Structural issues in the remaining two complexes are yet to be resolved, with unit owners potentially liable for expensive rectification works.

Ms Lawler on Thursday announced a raft of proposed changes to the Building Act, including:

""We know those issues around those residential apartments — the transfer slabs,"" Ms Lawler said. 

""These reforms that we are putting in place are there to address those issues."" 

Additionally, the government intends to increase the maximum penalty for disciplinary action against building practitioners to more than $25,000. 

It also plans to employ a new structural engineer within the department, increasing its ability to undertake physical audits of buildings. 

Ms Lawler said the proposed amendments were in line with recommendations made in the Building Confidence report, which was commissioned by Australia's federal, state and territory building ministers in 2018.

The executive director of the Master Builders Association NT, David Malone, cautioned the government against adding further complexity to existing regulations, but acknowledged the need for some reform. 

""When it comes to high-rise buildings, the only way to provide good consumer protection is actually to fix it in at the start, to design the building properly and to make sure all the systems are in place to build a good building,"" Mr Malone said.

""These reviews right now protect the consumer [although] they may add slightly to the cost. 

""But for those people who have been affected in the past, they'll say it's a very modest amount to get the quality that they wanted to receive right up front.""

The government plans to undertake a month of consultation about its proposed changes and hopes to implement the new development regime by the end of the year.

The Mordialloc building was deemed unsafe to occupy after an inspection by the Victorian Building Authority's (VBA) statewide cladding audit on Thursday. 

Most of the decade-old complex's 17 units were already vacant, with the four remaining residents given 48 hours to move out. 

The VBA's chief executive officer, Sue Eddy, said the decision was not taken lightly.

She said the building had a number of defects including combustible cladding on the external walls, insufficient essential safety measures and significant water damage that had led to extensive mould.

""An expert panel was convened and they made an assessment after looking at all the essential fire safety measure of this building that it was not viable for this building to remain occupied and that it needed to be vacated in the interests of public safety,"" Ms Eddy said.

She said she understood this could be a distressing time for the residents, but safety must take priority.

""I know this relocation may cause anxiety, but I want to assure the Victorian public that this was not a decision taken lightly,"" she said.

Ms Eddy said if current residents were unable to find alternative accommodation, the City of Kingston would be able to help them with their immediate needs.

""[The building's] state today is very concerning and this is the first time that we've come across a property where the experts haven't been able to come across a solution to keep the residents there.""

The City of Kingston used its powers to issue an emergency order giving the residents 48 hours to depart.

Mayor Georgina Oxley said the safety of residents was paramount.

""Due to the extreme fire risk identified, council has responded to the Victorian Building Authority's advisory reference panel recommendation and agreed to use its powers to issue an emergency order for the site,"" Cr Oxley said.

""The panel assessed the site as at the highest risk factor and council has responded to protect the safety of residents,"" she said.

She confirmed council had offered to provide assistance to residents if they could not find emergency accommodation.

This is the first building issued with an evacuation order since a Victoria-wide cladding audit begun in 2017.

The ABC understands the builder involved left the industry in 2015.

It is understood ongoing water leaks within the building caused a mould outbreak and concerns that the apartment complex was no longer structurally sound.

It is also believed the fire safety system was also damaged.

Cladding has been a major headache for the Andrews Government, as well as in other jurisdictions across Australia.

In July, Premier Daniel Andrews announced a $600 million package to deal with the flammable cladding crisis in Victoria, where about 500 buildings need rectification work to be made safe.

Sahil Bhasin, the national general manager at building inspection company Roscon, predicted more buildings would be slapped with evacuation orders as the cladding audit's focus shifted towards Melbourne's outer suburbs. 

""As the Victorian cladding audit and the Victorian Building Authority starts expanding its audit to the outer suburbs, this is going to become more and more prevalent because the housing stock in the outer suburbs is built to a price point and not towards quality in most cases,"" Mr Bhasin said.

""There are many building in the outer suburbs that are built out of compete expanded polystyrene, which is EPS, which is one of the claddings that are a concern.

""Apartment owners and unit owners should really be investing in some reporting and investigation to fast track this process and to alleviate their own concerns and not wait for the Victorian Government to catch up to the outer suburbs, because as you can see by this action, there is an actual severe danger to life.""

2021-10-28,ABC,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-15/darwin-building-inquiry-formed-into-potential-misconduct-action/11109120,2019-05-14,"Class action could be considered if Darwin apartment faults proven, say Master Builders - ABC News","Young mother Angel Worthington was less than thrilled to receive a letter telling her that structural problems had been identified in her Palmerston apartment block.

Living there with her two-year-old son Ashley, she had been named in the unenviable lottery of about 200 people in nine buildings across Darwin and Palmerston whose blocks may have been botched in the design phase.

""I don't think I've been informed enough — I think I should've received a call or an email straight away, instead of sending me a piece of paper in the mailbox,"" said Ms Worthington, who has been renting the apartment for six months.

""[The owner] hasn't called me, they haven't texted me, not one email, just that letter to say things need to be done.""

Her apartment block on Tarakan Court in Johnston is run by Venture Housing Company, which provides low-cost housing to Territorians.

In a statement, Venture said it had ""hand-delivered letters to all its tenants …  advising them [of the possible structural issues]"".

The company said it had now hired a structural engineer to prepare a ""detailed report"".

""Venture expects to receive this detailed structural engineer's report later this week and will advise its tenants of the report's findings,"" it said.

Once the report has been handed down, and if repairs were found to be needed, homeowners could have a better idea about what financial burdens they could be up against.

Both Venture and the Infrastructure Department have said that none of the nine buildings had been deemed unsafe.

A recent desktop analysis by the department revealed that all nine buildings had non-compliance issues relating to concrete structures known as ""transfer slabs"" — and that the same engineer responsible for all of them may have been involved in misconduct by approving them.

Now, the department has officially referred a complaint to the Building Practitioners Board to conduct an inquiry into whether engineer John Scott from JWS Constructions has engaged in misconduct, which, if proven, could lead to a suspension, fine or even cancellation of his licence. Currently, he remains registered as an approved certifier of construction work in the NT.

""I made sure there wouldn't be any delay in the matter,"" board chairman Paul Nowland told the ABC.

But action on prosecuting the man allegedly responsible for the issues could be cold comfort for the homeowners if they end up with a hefty bill.

An NT parliamentary committee in Darwin on Tuesday heard from departmental officials who confirmed that most of the owners would not be protected by an NT Government-regulated insurance scheme for some homeowners.

The Master Builders Fidelity Fund was launched by the NT Government in 2013 to protect consumers from defects.

""A lot of buildings are not covered by the Fidelity Fund because of the height of the buildings, and the age of the buildings,"" said the department's Mark Meldrum.

""Only a couple of them are covered by the Fidelity Fund.""

But even if regulations meant the fund wouldn't cover those affected, there could be scope to take legal action, said Master Builders NT executive director David Malone.

""They deserve to get a building that's fit for purpose, that's Australian consumer law,"" Mr Malone said.

""So they would still be able to go back and say the building is not fit for purpose, and be able to take action against the builder and the building practitioners that might have been involved in that project.""

He said a class action could be the ""most likely"" outcome for homeowners if the structural damages were eventually proven and repairs were required.

""You would expect that if there is a class problem, then you'd expect to get some kind of class action back,"" he said.

""But it's probably too early to pre-empt that at this stage, because we just don't know what the real affect of these issues are on the ground.""

One of those on the ground at the Tarakan Court address was renter Patrick Mossongo, a migrant from Congo with a background in the construction industry.

He was surprised that the non-compliance issues weren't found earlier on in the project.

""You don't inspect when the structure's finished — you inspect from the beginning,"" Mr Mossongo said.

While he remained optimistic things would work out, he said if any future works meant he would have to move out, it would cause him and his family upheaval.

""If it comes to have to relocate, maybe it would be difficult, because to find a new place, I don't think it would be easy in Darwin,"" Mr Mossongo said.

The exact date of the Building Practitioners Board's inquiry into Mr Scott's conduct currently remained unclear.

2021-10-28,ABC,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-28/qld-prisons-grossly-overcrowded-corrective-services-minister-say/6487008,2015-05-28,"Queensland prisons are grossly overcrowded, Corrective Services figures show - ABC News","Queensland's jails are overcrowded and becoming more dangerous for staff and prisoners, figures from the state's Corrective Services department show.

The State Government is urgently seeking a solution after discovering there are 1,600 prisoners sharing cells.

Prisons are cramped due to an increase of more than 20 per cent of inmates in the past two years, with more than 7,200 people now behind bars.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said Queensland was home to the country's fastest rising prison population.

No system is 100 per cent secure, but the Signal app uses end-to-end encryption and can protect your identity. Please read the terms and conditions.

The latest available figures show all of Queensland's 12 high security prisons are currently overcrowded and the rate of serious assaults has doubled in the past two years.

The ABC understands Corrective Services officials were also concerned water supply and sewerage systems could break due to the pressure of extra prisoners.

Queensland Corrective Services Minister Jo-Ann Miller said she was concerned about the rising number of prisoners flooding the system.

""The situation in Queensland is critical - when we came to government we certainly were not aware how bad the overcrowding was,"" she said.

""Today we have 7,268 prisoners in Queensland and my understanding is that the [high security] prison capacity is about 5,600.""

Ms Miller said that means there is now 800 more prisoners than there should be in the state's 12 high security prisons.

""I believe that the previous Liberal National Party government certainly kept these figures under wraps,"" she said.

QUT criminologist Professor Kerry Carrington said the overcrowding was a result of changing law and order policies under the former Newman government.

""If you cut services, you enhance and you strengthen the hard hand of the law and you'll end up with more people in jail at a significant cost to the taxpayer,"" she said.

Professor Carrington said there was also a large number of prisoners on remand.

""Around a quarter of the [prison] population, which is something like 1,600 prisoners, are un-sentenced, they're unconvicted, and they're sitting in jail,"" she said.

""You've also had a significant increase - more than a doubling of the number of prisoners who have applied for parole and are not being paroled.""

The number of assaults in Queensland jails had been rising considerably each month, reaching a peak of 191 assaults in December 2014.

In April 2015, there was an average of five assaults a day, with a monthly total of 14 assaults against prison staff and 17 assaults being deemed serious.

Assaults are considered serious when a prisoner needs hospital treatment or ongoing medical care, but only assaults prisoners admit took place are recorded.

Ms Miller said the rate of injury for prisoners and staff was unacceptable.

""We have a situation where there have been increased numbers of serious assaults on prison officers, there has also been an increased number of ordinary assaults,"" she said.

The ABS estimated it cost about $100,000 a year to keep a prisoner behind bars.

All Australian states and territories except Tasmania have seen a steady increase in prison populations, but Queensland had the highest increase last year - a 16 per cent jump.

Professor Carrington said the increase was highly unusual because there had not been an increase in crime.

""You've actually had a decline in the number of offenders coming before the courts, but a very significant increase in offenders being sentenced to prison, or being remanded in prison,"" she said.

It is understood the Queensland Government is working on a plan to ease the pressure by reopening the 500-bed Borallon Correctional Centre, west of Ipswich, this year.

Ms Miller said the State Government was still considering a range of solutions but nothing had been ruled in or out just yet.

""If judges send prisoners to jail we have to make sure there are enough jails to cope with this,"" she said.

""We are going to have to look at the different court systems for example, reinstating the Murri court, maybe having other types of courts being involved.""

Professor Carrington said the Queensland Government should see the crisis as a valuable opportunity for reform.

""We have a government that has a defect - you can't keep building jails over schools, we are at a point where we have to make choices,"" she said.
