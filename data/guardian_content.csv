2021-11-11,GUARDIAN,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/oct/14/more-than-a-quarter-of-new-sydney-apartment-blocks-have-defects-report-suggests,2021-10-13,"More than a quarter of new Sydney apartment blocks have defects, report suggests | Housing | The Guardian","More than one in four apartment blocks in Sydney built in the decade to 2017 likely have defects, although the true scope of the issue is unknown due to an “information vacuum”, a new report suggests.

Researchers with the University of New South Wales’ City Futures Research Centre have published the results of a three-year study examining how the state’s building industry handles defects in apartment buildings.

Thursday’s report, Cracks in the Compact City, examined 635 strata buildings across three council areas, Sydney, Parramatta and Canterbury-Bankstown. From this sample, researchers went back 10 years in order to find any documentation about defects identified in the properties and how they might have been addressed.

But with no one organisation responsible for keeping or managing the data, Dr Laura Crommelin, a senior lecturer in UNSW’s city planning program and the lead author of the report, said researchers were left “patching together” different data sources obtained from “everyone and anyone we could think of”.

“It was a really slow and frustrating process but it was incredibly enlightening at the same time because it highlighted how there is no clear set of data that tells us how bad this problem is,” Crommelin said.

Researchers found 26% of buildings in the sample with documented evidence of defects, though for some there was no information at all. Among those buildings with better documentation, more than half – 51% – showed signs of defect.

Water issues occurred in 42% of builds, cracking was found in 26% and fire safety issues were found in 17%. Attempting to fix these issues had triggered legal action that resulted in compensation payouts up to $14.3m.

As the report was delivered through an industry-partnership, it has not been peer-reviewed, though it has been reviewed by the project partners.

Its findings echoed an estimate released by the NSW building commissioner which conducted a survey of managers in strata complexes and found four in every 10 buildings has “some form of major defects”.

Crommelin said apartment hunters had been left “flying blind” and the “information asymmetry” was a byproduct of a regulatory environment that shifted all the risk – and the cost – onto individual buyers.

“A lot of people working in the system were incentivised not to have good data,” Crommelin said. “Part of the problem is that it’s been better for everyone to not know there’s a problem until it comes down to the owners and then they’re the ones left to handle the issue.”

NSW has been working to address these issues since a dramatic crack appeared in the Opal Tower in 2018 and residents were evacuated from the Mascot Towers in 2019.

Part of this has involved setting up the Office of the Building Commissioner – a development Crommelin said should be welcomed.

“Our commitment should be to making that a long-term program and not something we do for a couple of years and forget about,” she said. “If we do that, we’ll end up right where we started.”

Bronwyn Weir, a lawyer who was commissioned by the Building Ministers Forum in August 2017 to co-author a landmark report on regulation of the construction industry, said she was “not surprised” at the UNSW team’s findings.

When the landmark Building Confidence report was delivered in 2018, it found that despite attempts to create an industry that self-regulated, insurances and financiers had not played an oversight role.

“We found that, until relatively recently, there has been almost no effective regulatory oversight of the commercial building industry by regulators,” the report said.

Weir said that while she and her co-author, Prof Peter Shergold, were limited by their terms of reference, the UNSW team’s research highlighted significant consumer protection issues.

“There is a whole industry involved in defect-detection in multi-unit buildings,” Weir said. “The report really does highlight a very dubious post-construction world of defect identification management dispute that is an incredibly lucrative business model for the people in that part of the construction chain.”

She said NSW was unique in that laws giving apartment owners only two years to identify defects and seek compensation, before the claims became unenforceable, had created a predatory industry of consultants.

Weir said the NSW government had taken significant positive steps to address the issues but other states and territories lagged behind.

“NSW is finally doing something about it but is it the same in other states and territories?” Weir said. “There’s an assumption that what’s being done in NSW is working to change outcomes, but is that also being done elsewhere?”

2021-11-11,GUARDIAN,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/18/cracked-up-how-can-apartment-buyers-guard-against-a-defective-purchase,2019-06-17,Cracked up: how can apartment buyers guard against a defective purchase? | Housing | The Guardian,"With faults and cracks discovered over the weekend in Sydney’s Mascot Towers apartment complex – and similar cracks in Opal Tower six months ago – the spotlight is back on the quality of New South Wales apartment buildings.

Research from the University of NSW in 2015 found that 85% of new apartment buildings had defects at completion – mostly with waterproofing and fire detection systems – and the certification system had “broken down”.

With renewed debate around certification and building quality, Guardian Australia looked at the current consumer protections available in the state for those who recently bought an apartment, or are about to.

Six years for major defects, two years for other issues.

If you buy an apartment, you have a a statutory warranty under NSW law – but it starts from when the building is finished, not when the apartment was purchased.

And it only applies between the buyer and the builder – not the developer or architect. If the builder goes bankrupt, dies or disappears, your warranty could become impossible to enforce.

Philip Gall, the chairman of the Owners Corporation Network, says the current warranty is too short and too imprecise.

“What often happens is the builder or developer, to avoid their warranty obligations, wind up the companies,” he says. “Then there is nobody for the owners to pursue for defects.

“And there is always an argument as to what a ‘defect’ is.

“You’d be able to do that with a fridge but you can’t do that with an apartment. That is just appalling.”

For the residents of Mascot Towers, built 10 years ago, they are no longer covered by warranty.

This has changed a lot over the years, and gone through various names and reforms.

If your warranty is over, some buildings can access an insurance scheme that will pay for repairs, known as home building compensation (HBC).

But a 2002 change to NSW legislation means you are only covered if your apartment building is shorter than three storeys.

Previously, it was known as compulsory homeowner warranty insurance, and applied to all buildings, regardless of height.

“Many years ago, I had this experience myself [where the builder disappeared],” Gall says. “In the days when the homeowner warranty insurance was still around, we were able to get a large proportion of the cost of the defect paid for. You can’t do that any more.”

To fill that gap, in January 2018, the NSW government created a version of insurance for taller buildings, known as the strata building bond.

Under these rules, the developer pays 2% of the building contract price into a fund, held by the government, to repair any defects that are discovered within two years. After two years, the money is given back to the developer.

But Gall also criticised this as too little. “The problem is that two years is too short for these defects to become apparent, and 2% is way too small.”

Gall is blunt. “Don’t buy a new apartment over three storeys. Don’t do it.”

His advice is to aim for buildings that are older than 10 years, to inspect the strata minutes, and, if you have the money, get an independent certifier to check the building.

Buyers are entitled to look at the minutes of strata meetings to get a glimpse of the condition of the building.

“See whether they have had to deal with issues in those buildings,” Gall says. “You can get a pretty good idea in a 10-year-old building whether there are problems.”

If you have thousands of dollars spare, you can also pay for someone to inspect the building but it’s not a guarantee.

“You can get an independent certifier,” Gall says. “There are quite an industry of building consultants who will go and have a really good look at the building.

“But it is expensive. And almost all of these folk won’t do what is called destructive inspection – it’s just visual. If a crack has been filled in and painted over, they won’t know.”

For example, Gall says he doubts the fault in Mascot Tower could be picked up with an independent inspection.

“Once a building is built, to get a 100% reassurance from an independent expert is impossible,” he says.

“There are good developers and good builders out there but you don’t know who they are anymore. Some of the good ones are now producing worse quality. You simply don’t know if the builder you are dealing with is going to close down tomorrow, whether they are on the edge and cutting corners.

“My advice to people in the market for a new apartment is don’t. Don’t buy until it is six, seven, 10 years old.

“My advice to my kids is stick to the three-level walk-ups. If they are new, don’t go over three storeys. If they are old, check the strata records with someone who knows what they are looking at. And never buy off the plan.”

There are two options for reform that would make consumer rights stronger, Gall says.

The first would be to create a statutory duty of care for apartment buyers.

This means buyers could more easily sue builders, developers and architects for negligent work. Currently, under NSW tort law, negligence requires a person prove there was a duty of care between themselves and the negligent party.

“The problem with building is that it is not always clear who owes a duty of care to who,” Gall says. “The people who buy, buy from the developer, the developer has a contract with the builder, they have a contract with the architect. Who is it who owes a duty of care to the end purchaser?”

A statutory duty of care would make it clearer which parties could sue, and in the words of Gall, “put them all on the hook”.

“If an architect for example puts in a design inconsistent with the building code, and something fails, the architect can be on the hook.”

Gall and the Owners Corporation Network are also pushing for the creation of a special commission of inquiry, or a royal commission, into the issue of consumer protection for housing – looking at the changes to insurance, the three-storey rule and other issues.

An online survey commissioned by the parliamentary inquiry found that more than 90% of respondents are very dissatisfied or dissatisfied with the current process of private certification. Over 90% of respondents believe the consumer protections for owners and purchasers of new apartments and dwellings are inadequate or highly inadequate.

The findings suggest that the government’s recently announced reforms to the building industry may not go far enough to placate many home owners.

Under the reform package private certification will remain but the government plans to introduce laws requiring categories of building practitioners who are defined as “building designers” to formally declare that plans, specifications and performance solutions are compliant with the Building Code of Australia. Builders will need to declare that they built the building according to plans.

As well as the statutory warranty, the government plans to introduce an industry-wide duty of care to homeowners, owners’ corporations, subsequent titleholders and small businesses so that a broader range of building and construction practitioners are held to account for defective work, and to provide stronger protections.

The committee is due to hold hearings next week.

More than 390 people responded to the survey on the parliament’s website, and only a small proportion of them were from the high-profile buildings such as the Opal Tower and Mascot Towers, which have been evacuated due to building faults.

“Almost half of respondents are owners or residents of buildings with defects, including residents of Mascot Towers and buildings with flammable cladding,” the upper house MLC David Shoebridge said.

The report also revealed that there were mixed experiences when the defects involved common areas, which then became the responsibility of strata committees, which are responsible for the building.

There were contrasting responses to level of satisfaction with the response from the strata committee: 43% were very dissatisfied or dissatisfied, while 34% were satisfied or very satisfied.

The survey invited open-ended responses and revealed the heartbreak and stress that shoddy building standards cause.

“I am a strata manager and have spent the last 17 years dealing with defects, under various regimes. The process is unrelenting on owners, causing financial and emotional stress as first the insurers, and now builders, seek to fatigue owners’ corporations in litigation. I have cases 15 years on and still open,” one respondent in metropolitan Sydney wrote.

“Our owners’ corporation has been able to get compensation for defects but only by long court proceedings. We are now going through long and protracted rectification works, often uncovering further defects in the process,” another reported.

It was equally bad for tenants. One tenant in Zetland reported being electrocuted numerous times, dealing with water leaks through the apartment, living without hot water, and then being denied any compensation for the inconvenience.

But the interim report, released on Tuesday, could not make “definitive conclusions” about what precisely caused the damage in the new apartment building, which developed a dramatic crack on Christmas Eve.

One of the authors, Prof Mark Hoffman from the University of NSW, said residents should not move back in until new repairs and checks were completed, which would “stretch over many weeks”.

He said “significant rectification works” were needed that would turn the building “effectively into a construction site”.

The report found the building was structurally sound and not in danger of collapsing, but had many construction defects.

Two hob beams had “safety [standards] lower than required by standards”, a dowel bar between a hob beam and a panel “was observed to be incomplete”, precast concrete panels were found to be 200mm wide, instead of 180mm, and a series of reinforcing bars were found to be 20mm, instead of 28mm. Asked if these were significant faults, Hoffman said it was too early to tell.

The report concluded that engineers needed more information to make definitive conclusions about the cause or causes of the damage.

The NSW planning minister, Anthony Roberts, said he wanted to “make very clear this is an interim report” and more reports would follow.

He said the question of whether residents should re-enter their homes was “beyond the scope” of the report, but Hoffman said he would recommend residents wait.

On Friday the company that built the tower, Icon Co, declared it was safe for residents to return home over the weekend.

But the chairman of the body corporate, Shady Eskander, said residents overwhelmingly refused to move back.

“A meeting was held last Saturday, 300-plus owners of the site attended,” he said. “Overwhelmingly we will not return to the site … until independent engineers have said on letterhead that it is safe to move in.

“No resident wants to live on a construction site. We have suffered. People were buying into the Australian dream and unfortunately this has become an Australian nightmare for us.”

Roberts said he understood their decision.

“Whether they move back into the building is a matter between residents and the builder. I completely understand residents’ reluctance to move back into what is essentially for some time a building site.”

An inquiry began on Monday into the regulation of building standards, quality and disputes in New South Wales, after a series of incidents involving damaged unit buildings.

Residents of the Mascot complex’s 132 apartments have been forced to stay elsewhere since the building was evacuated in mid-June due to cracking in the primary support structure and facade.

One of the apartment owners, Vijay Vital, broke down as he told the NSW upper house inquiry the situation had devastated his family.

“I stand here as a parent ... my daughter asked me, ‘when can I go home?’” Vital said.

Mascot Towers has high strata fees compared to neighbouring buildings and had been plagued by defects due to substandard materials and negligence, he alleged.

“This has caused a lot of trauma in the past two months because we were evacuated, the reason for which we don’t know,” he said.

“We have insurance but we can’t claim any of it until we know the root cause.”

Another owner, Alton Chen, said for a lot of Mascot residents their apartment was “the only place we call home”.

“We don’t know when we can go back, we don’t know how much we need to pay for in the future,” Chen told the inquiry.

He said without the state government’s assistance package a lot of owners would be paying for “mortgages for a place we can’t live in” and the cost of alternative accommodation.

The department of customer services executive John Tansey couldn’t say exactly when the new building and development certifiers bill – which was passed in October 2018 – would come into effect.

The legislation will give the government compliance and enforcement powers, the right to suspend or cancel a certifier’s registration and allows for substantial fines for body corporates which do not have sufficient insurance.

“I don’t want to quote an ad hoc date, we need to develop the regulations, we need to get those right in consultation with industry,” Tansey told the inquiry.

The Greens MP and committee chair David Shoebridge replied: “You’d understand the frustration that legislation that was hurried through parliament ... is still not in effect.”

In a submission to the inquiry, the Mascot Towers Owners Corporation, said the NSW government had failed to establish a sufficiently tough regulatory framework for builders, certifiers and property developers.

There had been a failure of the private building certification process, a lack of supervision over builders and an unfair burden on owners to rectify defects.

The submission outlined Mascot Towers’ various defects leading up to the cracking problem, including lukewarm water all year round, severe stormwater flooding and the incorrect use of electrical cables. The building was passed for occupation despite these faults, it said.

“Our residents have inherited a building with numerous defects ... which were originally signed off on by our government, engineers and certifiers as ‘within standards’.

“Somewhere along the line, maximising profit has become a misinterpretation for ‘delivering quality’.”

The group said NSW should fund repairs to Mascot Towers as the defects “happened under the watch of government”.

David Chandler, appointed this month as the inaugural NSW building commissioner, will start in his new role later this week.

The newly-built tower in Sydney Olympic Park was evacuated on Christmas Eve after cracks were found in the building, sparking fears it could collapse.

The NSW government-commissioned report found that while the building was structurally sound overall, horizontal support beams in the building were of inferior strength and were not compliant.

The decision to only partially grout between the beams and panels added to the problem.

“A number of structural design and construction issues, including non-compliance with national codes and standards, were responsible for the observed damage at Opal Tower,” News Corp quoted the report as saying.

“We found some of the hob beams and panel assemblies were under-designed according to the National Construction Code and Australian Standards, leaving the beams prone to failure.

“We consider the building is overall structurally sound and the localised damage to the building can be rectified.”

The expert engineers’ report recommended creating databases of registered engineers and NSW building certifications, along with a building structure review board to monitor known property design flaws and shape future building codes.

About 170 Opal Tower apartments have been deemed fit for reoccupation but 224 units were still unfit earlier this month, with dozens of families still left in temporary accommodation.

The NSW minister for planning, Anthony Roberts, and the minister for better regulation, Matt Kean, are scheduled to respond to the report on Friday morning along with Professor Mark Hoffman, one of the authors of the report.

Residents from the 30 loft-style apartments at 19 Gadigal Avenue in Zetland, in Sydney’s south-west, were evacuated late last year, while City of Sydney staff had inspected the building in February and found it had “extensive and severe water damage”, a city spokesman said.

“The water damage caused the failure of the internal fire-rated construction throughout several apartments. The fire-rated construction is required to separate individual apartments and common areas during a fire,” the spokesman told the Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday.

The news follows the evacuation of Sydney Olympic Park’s Opal Tower on Christmas Eve and the Mascot Towers on Bourke Street last month as the New South Wales government scrambles to overhaul building standards.

The newly built block in Sydney Olympic Park was evacuated on Christmas Eve after cracks found in the building sparked fears it could collapse.

Remedial structural works are expected to be finished in early August, but some 63 apartments will be ready for re-occupation in mid-July, builder Icon said in a statement last week.

Residents of the 132 units in Mascot Towers, in the city’s south, remain unable to return to their complex.

It was evacuated in mid-June due to cracking in its primary support structure and facade masonry.

The minister responsible for building regulation Kevin Anderson is looking at reforms to the industry, with the government releasing a discussion paper in June.

The consultation period closes at the end of July and Anderson on Wednesday urged the public to comment on the policy which would ultimately form legislation.

The state government has also committed to appointing a building commissioner.

Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Wednesday said she wanted to assure the public that the government knew there was a problem around building regulations.

“We know there’s a gap in legislation. We allowed the industry to self-regulate and it hasn’t worked,” she told reporters on Wednesday.

“There are too many challenges, too many problems and that’s why the government’s moving to legislate.”

Opposition leader Jodi McKay said NSW Labor didn’t oppose the government taking time to consult on legislation, but wanted to know when the building commissioner would be in place.

On Thursday, the New South Wales planning minister, Anthony Roberts, announced two deans of engineering would lead the investigation into Opal Tower, which was evacuated on Christmas Eve.

Mark Hoffman from the University of New South Wales and John Carter from the University of Newcastle will investigate why the tower cracked, whether it is safe, and make recommendations for the future.

But as fallout from the evacuation continues, a poor compliance system in New South Wales and a “she’ll be right” attitude have been blamed for the high rate of defects in Sydney buildings.

The high-rise apartment block developed a crack on a wall on the 10th floor on Monday. Though the building was declared safe on Wednesday, 51 apartments were still blocked to residents on Thursday morning.

Prof Bill Randolph from the University of NSW’s City Futures Research Centre said there was “an industry-wide problem”.

“This sort of thing has been known about for some years now … The rate at which multi-units have been put up in the last four or five years has really stretched the capacity of the building industry to deal with it.”

A damning 2015 report from Engineers Australia found that 85% of new strata units were defective on completion and the certification system in NSW had “broken down”.

Randolph said the state’s compliance regime had been privatised in the early 2000s, which meant developers were now effectively “signing off on their own buildings”.

“The developer effectively walks away from the building once the last unit has been sold,” he said. “We call it split incentives. When you’re a developer, the incentive is to build it quickly, sell it quickly.

“The people who buy it then have to deal with anything that goes wrong [while] the developer can simply walk away from what they have built.

“It’s not that there isn’t enough regulation. There are plenty of regulations but they’re poorly enforced.”

Jonathan Russell, head spokesman for Engineers Australia, said members had told him that certifiers often did not have the qualifications or experience to make an informed judgment about the quality of works.

“This is most prevalent for engineering works, such as engineered fire safety systems,” he said. “Also, for those who want to do the right thing and engage an engineer, there is no government register of licensed or registered engineers.

“While the person who paints the structure needs to be licensed, the person who designs the structure does not.”

He said recommendations from the Engineers Australia report still hadn’t been taken up, three years on: “Full and swift implementation of all 24 recommendations is the single most important action that the NSW government can take.”

Phil Dwyer, the president of the Builders Collective of Australia, said there was a “she’ll be right” approach to building.

“There are many thousands of building failures, particularly in NSW and Victoria,” he said. “We saw this coming but without a doubt but never expected the dilapidation of our industry to continue for so long.”

On Wednesday the developer of Opal Tower, Ecove, declared the building was safe for habitation and was not affected by major issues.

Dwyer disagreed: “How one part can be at fault and the rest be OK? Give me a break. If one part is questionable, the whole building is questionable.”

But on Thursday Ecove denied that the fault in Opal Tower was part of a pattern.

“Any suggestion the building damage pointed to ‘a broader pattern in the industry’ is completely wrong,” said Ecove’s director, Bassam Aflak. “The city’s ‘development boom’ has not led to cutting of corners. There has been no cutting of corners.

“It’s too early to leap to any conclusions, for instance, to speculate on wider building issues because of what appears to be one failed panel.

“The requirement from the Sydney Olympic Park Authority was that the building be high quality and we have delivered on that. While this incident suggests otherwise, the contract with Icon specified that the building be of high-quality Australian design and construction.”

Randolph said it was surprising to see such a dramatic fault emerge in “what is normally thought of as a premium location”, and it pointed to further problems at the cheaper end of the market.

“It’s been brewing for some time,” he said. “Strata managers, the defects engineers, the lawyers who deal with the owners of units know this has been a problem for some time. I suspect the developer industry has been aware of it as well.”

On Thursday, Roberts promised the outcomes of his new investigation would be made public. The regulation minister, Matt Kean, also said renters who were affected could access support through Fair Trading.

“Renters might not know that they don’t need to give notice to leave a property should their property be damaged and wholly or partly uninhabitable,” he said.

Michael Lambert, the former secretary of NSW Treasury, was commissioned by the government to look into the failings of building regulation in NSW, after a fire in a building in Bankstown in 2012 revealed shocking breaches of the building code.

Two young women leapt from the fifth floor of the building to escape the fire. Connie Zhang died while Ginger Jiang was severely injured. Subsequent investigations revealed an illegal roof over the atrium that held smoke in, and multiple breaches of fire safety requirements.

But while the NSW government moved promptly to tighten up on certification of fire safety systems in high rise buildings, Lambert says the rest of his nearly 150 recommendations have languished.

“It’s very frustrating,” he said. “It’s been three years. The fire safety issue was a time bomb so they did something on that, but they haven’t implemented the rest of the report,” he said. 

The cracks that appeared in the 34-storey Opal Tower at Olympic Park just before Christmas, causing the evacuation hundreds of residents, have again turned the spotlight on NSW’s building regulation, and more broadly, on whether Australia will emerge from the latest housing boom with a legacy of substandard buildings.

The Lambert report found “the incidents of building defects is significant” and “the incidence appears higher in NSW than elsewhere”.

But he wasn’t able to be clearer than that, because there are still no audits of buildings to assess whether they meet the required standards. The only statistics on defects collected by government are those generated by people complaining about their builders to NSW Fair Trading.

A 2012 survey by the City Futures project the University of NSW surveyed 1,020 strata owners across NSW, and found 72% of all respondents (85% in buildings built since 2000) knew of at least one significant defect in their complex.

As the building boom has gathered pace, the problems have probably got worse, Lambert says.

Developers, who do not require any qualifications, have piled into the industry, and the demand for tradespeople has meant that less qualified people are working on major projects.

In NSW there is no requirement for builders to be licensed if they are working on commercial projects, though residential builders are required to hold licences in order to access home warranty insurance.

“The Opal Tower is likely the tip of the iceberg,” Lambert told Guardian Australia. “There are hundreds of smaller projects, mainly medium rise in the suburbs, that will have problems.”

Lambert produced his draft report in August 2015 and a final report in October of that year, which outlined a litany of problems in building regulation in NSW.

These included fragmented responsibility within government, multiple agencies that were underresourced, no requirements on those checking building work – the certifiers – to have proper qualifications and a lack of any audits to see whether they were doing their job.

He put forward more than 100 recommendations, including 12 he said should be implemented within six months from the date of the final report, which was October 2015.

While Lambert backed the continued use of private certifiers to sign off on building work, he suggested a top-to-bottom overhaul of the system to strengthen it.

This included making one minister responsible for building regulation; bringing agencies together; introducing reforms aimed at greater independence and professionalisation for certifiers; making other professionals in the system more accountable; and introducing a system of audits so that the public could be confident that certifiers were performing their role.

He also urged the government to properly resource the regulators, after finding “significantly lower resourcing of regulators” in NSW than other states.

The government moved promptly to require those certifying fire safety systems to have competency in that area. The Fire Safety Association will now set the standards for those signing off on fire systems. Previously, no fire-specific qualifications were required.

But Lambert recommended a major overhaul for all certifiers, designed to boost their independence from developers, who pay for their services, and to professionalise the industry.

Most states now rely on private certifiers to ensure building standards are met. In NSW people can opt to have a council-employed inspector or a private certifier employed by the developer, to sign off that building work is to code and in line with the development consent. In practice, most builders and developers use private certifiers, especially on major projects like high rise residential buildings.

In its response to his report, the government promised to pass new laws dealing with the role and qualifications of certifiers by the second half of 2017.

A bill, which fell short of Lambert’s expectations, was put out for consultation in September 2018 and was passed in October. A spokesman for the fair trading and innovation minister, Matt Kean, said it would come into force in the next few months.

The explanatory note on the bill said it “clarifies a certifier’s role and responsibilities, enhances independence, strengthens disciplinary procedures and facilitates better coordination of certifier functions”.

Lambert told Guardian Australia he had tried in vain to progress the report with two successive ministers for fair trading and innovation, Victor Dominello and Kean.

“The bureaucrats don’t want change and ministers do not seem motivated to push change,” he said.

One of his key recommendations was that building regulation be brought under the control of one minister. At the moment, the minister for planning is responsible for implementing the national building codes at state level and attends the intergovernmental meetings , but licensing of residential builders and certifiers rests with the minister for fair trading and is treated as a consumer issue.

The government agreed to consolidation in 2016 in its response to the Lambert report, but nothing has happened. A spokesperson said the government remained to committed to the goal and it was a matter of “sequencing”.

The government also agreed to establish a high level committee of regulators and a consultation committee to help progress reform. But again, nothing has happened.

Lambert said: “I arranged for the current minister, Matt Kean, to meet with industry and he had agreed at that meeting to set up a committee to help fast-track the reforms and provide feedback. But later he walked away from it.”

The other problem identified was the largely paper-based systems relating to buildings. Paperwork is spread across councils, the Department of Planning and the certifiers’ files, making it difficult for building purchasers and neighbours to find out whether the building has been certified as complying with the building standards.

“As a priority step to fill data gaps, amendments will be prepared for introduction into parliament before the end of 2016, the government said in its response to Lambert.

“These will provide the power to require certifying authorities and accreditation holders to report certain building and development data.”

Again, this step seems to have fallen by the wayside.

After the Opal Tower evacuation, Kean announced that 25% to 30% of the industry would be audited. The details of the audit program are under consideration and have yet to be announced, so it is unclear whether this will involve checking buildings to see whether they are in line with what has been certified, or checking the paperwork.

Asked about the slow progress, Kean, who became minister in January 2017, disagreed.

“Michael Lambert was asked to review laws regulating certifiers. In October, I passed nation-leading certification reforms, implementing Michael Lambert’s key recommendations, with serious penalties for certifiers who do the wrong thing,” he told Guardian Australia.“The Lambert Review was superseded by the Shergold Weir report that was initiated by the federal building ministers’ forum. NSW has led the nation in implementing the recommendations from this report.”

Following the worldwide scare about aluminium composite cladding after the Grenfell tower disaster in London, Prof Peter Shergold AC and Bronwyn Weir examined the building regulatory systems across jurisdictions, as well as the broader problems that impact the effective implementation of the national construction code.

Their report was delivered to the building ministers’ forum in April 2018 and made recommendations to improve Australian building safety and compliance.

Kean will deliver his response to the Shergold Weir report before the next building ministers’ forum in February.

But in the meantime, one of the biggest building booms in Australian history has seen skylines around the country changed forever, as literally hundreds of medium and high density projects are constructed, arguably under regulatory systems full of holes.

The Opal Tower saga is emblematic of that system. Just who is to blame will likely take some time to sort out. The government has asked two engineering professors to urgently investigate the tower’s safety, after cracks appeared.

“I do not want to pre-empt Professor Hoffman and Professor Carter’s investigation into the Opal Tower,” Kean said. “What we have seen at the Opal Tower is clearly unacceptable and my heart goes out to the residents.

“Your home is often your biggest investment and people have every right to expect that their home is safe and free from defects. That it is especially the case when it is a new building like the Opal Tower.”

But once immediate liability is sorted out, it might be worth reflecting on the full cost of regulatory inertia.

Birds chirp, dairy cows roam the valley and a wet winter has left the area carpeted in verdant greenery. The national gaze has long since moved beyond Australia’s black summer bushfires, and even here at ground zero it is possible to imagine that day can be forgotten.

But only for a brief moment. When the sun pokes above the adjacent ridge, it illuminates row after row of barren trees that betray the tranquillity. A potent reminder of the fire’s enduring impact, the trees are upright but still yet to recover. The same is true of those who inhabit this beautiful but now melancholy part of far-south New South Wales. For many, the long road to recovery has only just begun.

As he surveys this vista from the construction site that is his home, Graeme Freedman is insistent. “I wasn’t going to be burnt off this site by a fucking bushfire,” he says. 

Freedman and his wife, Robyn, fled on the morning of New Year’s Eve, half an hour before the fire storm hit their property. Neighbours stayed to fight – and lost their lives. The Freedmans have spent most of the past 22 months trying to rebuild. It remains a work in progress.

As the the second anniversary of the black summer bushfires approaches, less than one in 10 families who lost their homes on the south coast have finished rebuilding. An investigation by Guardian Australia has found that planning difficulties, labour shortages, underinsurance and a lack of support from government has left many stranded in caravans. As support services are withdrawn – the deployment of case managers from state government agencies has ended and mental health programs are finishing – local advocates have hit out at what they see as the abandoning of bushfire survivors.

“It is so heartbreaking to see people still struggling nearly two years on,” says Leanne Atkinson, who is funded by Catholic Social Services to help communities recover. “There are a significant number of people falling through the cracks, living without adequate housing, access to water and sanitation.”

In two of the worst-hit local government areas, Bega Valley and Eurobodalla, almost 1,000 homes were lost. Data obtained by Guardian Australia shows that barely 7.5% of survivors have finished rebuilding. Across Bega, of 467 homes that were lost, the council has received only 117 applications to rebuild. In other words, three in four families have not even commenced the planning process.

“Rebuilding their homes isn’t as simple as it may seem,” local MP Kristy McBain says. “The paperwork and red tape can be difficult to understand at the best of times but it’s even more difficult for people experiencing trauma and dealing with the mental, emotional and physical stress of rebuilding after the fires.”

The first step in rebuilding involves the preparation of a development application. It took the Freedmans five months to submit their application – for a one-bedroom granny flat – such is the complexity of the planning process. After the 2009 bushfires in Victoria, laws were amended to make it easier for survivors. This time around in NSW, only minor legislative changes were made. “We thought some of the lessons from Black Saturday might have been learned,” Freedman says. “We expected some easing of building requirements, some assistance in terms of planning. But there was none.”

Construction began last November. It has been a slow process. There is a significant skills and materials shortage in regional Australia. It has been made worse by an influx of sea- and tree-changers during the pandemic, often flush with cash for renovations and incentivised by the federal government’s homebuilder scheme. “That’s chewed up all the resources,” Freedman says.

Every time the Freedmans needed a new speciality – a plumber, an electrician, a tiler – there would be a month-long delay. Freedman says some tradespeople in the region have stopped taking bushfire jobs, which are often out-of-town, more complex and more time consuming. “There are just not enough tradies and there is a scarcity of building materials,” adds Atkinson.

As a result, the Freedmans have lived in a small caravan as their rebuilding efforts moved at a snail’s pace. At one point they begged an elderly tiler to come out of retirement. That was a stroke of good fortune. Neighbours have been told the earliest they can get a tiler is March 2022. One delay can have a domino effect.

The fire was so intense that underground infrastructure – piping, cabling, sewerage – had been destroyed too. Because it is not covered by typical insurance policies, the Freedmans have been left $100,000 out of pocket. Hikes in material costs as a result of higher fire ratings have also meant that most survivors are significantly underinsured. A recent report by the Insurance Council of Australia admitted that underinsurance was a “real and significant issue” in bushfire-hit areas.

Freedman has raised these challenges with government at all levels. “There ain’t nobody to listen,” he says. Where money can solve problems, there has been some help – extensive funding has gone into mental health services. But as Freedman noted in a submission to a Senate inquiry: “To people who have lost everything … mental health is getting out of a caravan.” Practical support informed by the reality on the ground has been lacking. “This is a problem you can’t throw money at,” he adds.

Cumulatively, Freedman’s experience of the past two years has amounted to what he calls “bureaucracy-induced trauma”. He recently saw a trailer for the new ABC series, Fires, which ends with a voiceover: “You are not alone in this.” The dissonance between drama and reality left him reeling. “What a load of shit,” he says. “There’s been nobody here for us, no one here to help. We’ve been abandoned from day one.”

The Freedmans’ story is alarming. Yet it represents the tip of the iceberg – if anything, they are ahead of the rebuilding curve. The Freedmans will be in their home by Christmas (even if it is just a granny flat – they anticipate that fully rebuilding will take another four years). But many remain in their caravans or sheds. Just last week, Bega council was forced to extend an exemption that permits bushfire survivors to live in temporary accommodation on-site while they rebuild.

The University of Melbourne’s Prof Lisa Gibbs says authorities were well aware of this “long tail of recovery”. After the Black Saturday bushfires of 2009, Gibbs and her colleagues conducted a longitudinal study of the impact on survivors. The research underscored the enduring nature of the trauma. Within four years, a quarter of study participants had been diagnosed with a mental health condition. A decade on, almost one in five survivors was still experiencing financial distress. In communities that had been hit hard, just one-third felt their community had “mostly” or “fully recovered”.

“One of the recommendations from our research is that there should really be a five-year recovery plan,” says Gibbs “There’ll be an influx of services and support in the immediate period. But there needs to be an appreciation that [the support] needs to be there for years and transition into local mainstream services so that people are not left hanging.”

On Cobargo’s main street, the volunteer-run relief centre has sought to support bushfire survivors. It began operating on day one of the disaster, initially set up at the showgrounds to help evacuees. Ever since, it has evolved to provide whatever support is needed by the community. In the absence of government assistance, the local branch of the Maritime Union is paying the rent for the centre’s quaint cottage headquarters.

“There’s no end in sight,” says volunteer Danielle Murphy. “People can’t move forward – they keep facing obstacles, red tape thrown up, lack of trades. A lot of people are in the same spot they were last year.”

Murphy says the pandemic meant that some of the government services now being withdrawn were never fully utilised. “They haven’t extended any deadlines,” she says. “They’re pulling out and people are at a loss.”

Atkinson regularly drops by the cottage to swap information with Murphy and her colleagues. With a remit spanning from the Victorian border to Batemans Bay, she spends hours on the road trying to help individuals and communities. Atkinson admits the sheer volume of work is overwhelming, even two years on. “I feel like I let people down, I feel guilty when I take time off,” she says, her voice wavering with emotion. “We’ve got a long way to go.”

2021-11-11,GUARDIAN,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/04/the-crane-mutiny-how-sydneys-apartment-boom-spun-out-of-control,2018-01-03,The crane mutiny: how Sydney's apartment boom spun out of control | Sydney | The Guardian,"Across the road, a giant crane has been working on a new block of apartments on the site of a former service station. Another is going up down the road, where the bank used to be. More units are planned for the local RSL site and for two factories within a few hundred metres, and on dozens of other sites in my inner-western Sydney suburb that were previously industrial buildings, commercial premises, car parks or waste ground.

 Go a bit further afield and the pace of medium- and high-density redevelopment is mind-boggling. Across Sydney’s inner and middle-ring suburbs, from Rockdale and Wolli Creek in the south, through the inner west, out to Parramatta, up to Ryde and on to the suburbs along the north shore train line, the city is changing before our eyes. 

All Australia’s state capitals have seen versions of the same phenomenon but the pace and scale of change in Sydney is exceptional. On the face of it, creating more densely populated neighbourhoods along existing transport corridors makes perfect sense – it has been the policy of successive state governments for the best part of 30 years, in various guises. The downsides of encouraging the city to sprawl across an ever larger area are obvious. Bringing more people within reach of the city, with greater density around local hubs, should in theory be more environmentally sustainable, reduce car dependence, alleviate property price pressures and help create the diverse, vibrant neighbourhoods most residents want.

But that theory is not working out.

A poll published in Fairfax Media in October found 66.4% of residents agreed that Sydney was “full” and development should be pushed outside the metro area. Across the suburbs, local groups are fiercely resisting plans for more building. In the south the proposed development of the Sydenham-to-Bankstown rail corridor has become a lightning rod for discontent. A plan to build 2,600 units in towers of up to 28 storeys in the inner west has run into outraged opposition under the slogan “Marrickville, not Mirvacville”. In October an even larger proposed development at Rhodes East, on the Parramatta river, was savaged by the local Liberal state MP, John Sidoti, who said some of what was proposed was “just plain wrong”.

 It seems nothing can stop the building, short of an economic downturn. But how have governments failed so dismally to persuade Sydneysiders of the benefits of higher-density living? And is it too late to rescue the benefits of a more compact, less car dependent, more sustainable city?

Australian cities have long been among the least dense in the world. According to weighted calculations by the blog chartingtransport.com, Sydney had a density of 36 people for every hectare in 2011, compared with 80 in London, 133 in Paris and an astonishing 246 in Barcelona. No one wants Sydney to emulate the less attractive features of the most tightly packed European cities (lack of green space, for example) but there has been a consensus among planners and politicians at least since the 1980s that increasing density in established suburbs makes much more sense than continuing to expand outwards.

Planning is only one factor behind the apartment-building boom. Years of low interest rates and the incentives for investing provided by negative gearing and capital gains tax arrangements underpin every aspect of the Australian property market. But in Sydney successive state governments have encouraged the rezoning of industrial and commercial sites near transport routes, and since 2014 the New South Wales Department of Planning and Environment has identified “priority precincts” for high-density development – 28 at the last count – described as having “good access to existing or planned public transport connections” and “suitable for rejuvenation with new homes and jobs”.

 Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show monthly building approvals for apartments in Sydney topped 3,000 for the first time in September 2013, then 4,000 in December 2014 and 5,000 in July 2016, before falling off last year. That meant 78,000 units were approved between 2012 and 2015, RBA figures show, an increase of 18% on the existing apartment stock. In November 2016 the then planning minister, Rob Stokes, announced plans for a further 184,000 homes by 2021, to win “the war against sprawl” with “a real focus on apartments, on terrace houses and on medium-density developments in established areas”. 

 As a result, by the end of last year, more than 350 cranes were at work in Sydney, more than half of the total in the whole of Australia, of which 85% were involved in residential construction. And in contrast to other Australian cities, they are spread throughout the suburbs rather than concentrating in the central business district. In 2016, for the first time, more apartments than houses were built in Australia, and Sydney, where flats now account for 28% of housing, is well ahead of the average. 

 Public hostility to increasing density comes in many forms and is far from uniform. Research by the Centre for Urban Transitions at Swinburne University suggests that residents of established inner and middle suburbs in both Sydney and Melbourne have “a growing capacity to accept change but at present it is grudging and not strongly endorsed”.

 Some grounds for that unhappiness are obvious. Higher density development has not yet fulfilled the hopes of those who claim lack of supply is the key to taming rampant property prices, despite recent signs of the market weakening. But it has contributed to ever greater inequality, according to three reports produced last year for Shelter by the City Futures Research Centre at the University of NSW. 

 The quality of construction is a further concern. In 2015 Engineers Australia warned that the building system in NSW had “broken down” and a major incident was inevitable as units were being built by developers who were “totally inexperienced”. Hazel Easthope, a senior research fellow at the City Futures centre, says her research has uncovered “an incredibly high incidence of building defects”, including fire safety non-compliance, major leaks and structural cracking in new buildings. 

 But emotions run highest over more existential questions about what higher densities are doing to indefinable qualities such as the “character” of suburbs, and the stresses brought by a dramatic influx of residents without a corresponding expansion of services. 

In December the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, told Fairfax she wanted the best of all worlds. 

“I for one … don’t want communities to lose their local character,” she said. “I want people to feel they are living in good urban environments with greenery and green space. But also we have to look at opportunities where we can increase supply. People do want to downsize, upsize, have choice of housing.”

Sometimes that circle simply cannot be squared. There is a tension here that to some extent mirrors the broader housing divide between baby boomer property owners and those locked out of the market. Campaigners against development – particularly those arguing for the preservation of “heritage” in leafy suburbs where freestanding houses command astronomical prices – inevitably leave themselves open to the charge that they simply want higher densities pushed into poorer and more distant areas. 

 In July the chief executive of the Committee for Sydney, Tim Williams, accused north shore residents of “high-octane nimbyism” in rejecting plans for more housing. And some opposition to development has been explicitly hostile to greater density under any circumstances. 

 On the northern beaches, an unlikely coalition of the former Labor premier Barrie Unsworth and the former federal Liberal MP Bronwyn Bishop held forth at a public meeting last April about the threats to the beaches lifestyle, Fairfax reported. “High-density living is what most people who live here have come to escape,” Bishop told the meeting. Unsworth attacked the controversial new B-Line bus service along the peninsula – not for its deficiencies as a transport project but as “a Trojan horse” for development.

 But most opponents of the current strategy vehemently deny they are against densification in itself.

 The Sydenham to Bankstown Alliance highlights the threat to the character of suburbs such as Hurlstone Park and Dulwich Hill from the priority precinct plans associated with construction of the metro line that is scheduled to replace the train line from Sydenham to Bankstown, eventually linking the south-west suburbs with Chatswood on the north shore. 

 “The level and scale of development proposed is random, arbitrary and brutal in its approach, resulting in suburbs that will be left with little of the charm, heritage and character which attracted residents to the area in the first place,” the alliance’s website says.

Its spokesman, the former Marrickville Greens councillor Peter Olive, says defence of heritage is only part of the alliance’s case.

 “I don’t think that’s overly controversial or a sign necessarily of nimbyism, it’s just saying there are historical buildings here that need to be preserved, historical streetscapes, townships, villages if you like, that should be given some sort of greater consideration rather than having the broad brush of a 400-metre or 800-metre radius circle drawn over it for densification.”

 He cites the “very strong reservations” of the fomer administrators of both the Inner West council and Canterbury-Bankstown council (appointed after the government forcibly merged elected local councils), who pointed to shortfalls in open space, impacts on local traffic and inadequate provisions for schools and healthcare in the plans.

 “Neither of those two persons are nimbys – they are both state government appointees,” Olive says.

 It is the failure to provide infrastructure and services to keep pace with population growth that has really fuelled public discontent, says Hazel Easthope of the City Futures Research Centre.

 “One of the things that makes me mad is when I hear people saying in the media, ‘This is just nimbys who don’t want apartments in their area,’” Easthope says. 

 She believes many people would accept more density if it meant they also got more frequent transport services, more school places, a better choice of shops and services and improved housing affordability.

 “That’s pretty much the narrative we’re getting. It’s not that people are saying they’re against density. It’s that they don’t believe that all the things they’ve been told are going to come with it are actually going to come with it.”

 Corinne Fisher represents the Better Planning Network, an umbrella group for more than 400 local organisations. She says hostility to development stems ultimately from “a complete failure of process” in consulting residents before large projects are announced.

 “If you’re going to ask people to accept, in the case of the Sydenham to Bankstown corridor, tens of thousands of new homes, then you need to come out upfront with a financial commitment for the … infrastructure that you are going to contribute to this development. And that really hasn’t happened anywhere.

 “Densification can be done well … but you need to respect what people are telling you they love about their neighbourhood and to work with them to protect these features. And that may be that you don’t build so high. At the moment, the people driving the developments, and the heights of the units within any particular precinct, they are not the residents, they’re the developers. There is only one category of people driving the government’s decision making.”

The planning minister, Anthony Roberts, denies that claim, saying collaboration with local councils and early engagement with the community is a “fundamental element” of the planned precincts program.

“This ensures a planned approach to creating new homes and jobs located close to public transport, shops and services, while retaining and enhancing local character.”

Roberts cites the provision of 2.4 hectares of open space and a commitment of $22m in transport upgrades to support redevelopment around North Ryde station as an example of the government’s response to community consultation.

 But both Easthope and Fisher say the government has relaxed its control of the densification strategy.

“If you look back at the 2005 metropolitan strategy, it was quite prescriptive about where the new development would occur,” Easthope says. “And then it didn’t occur in those locations – because the market didn’t support development in those areas. And then if you look at the 2014 metropolitan strategy, it’s much more pragmatic about the fact that delivery of apartments is largely market-led.”

 Fisher blames wholesale rezoning and the “outrageous” ad hoc nature of the precinct designations for undermining the Greater Sydney Commission, the body that is meant to coordinate planning for the city. 

 “The public has no idea how the government is coming to these decisions and they also have no input as to where those priority precincts appear – suddenly there’s an announcement and, the next thing you know, they’re slapped with a proposal for thousands of new homes in their neighbourhood,” Fisher says. “And they basically have to accept the situation.

 “It’s farcical, because the Greater Sydney Commission can’t keep up with the announcements.”

The commission declined to comment.

 Politically, the winds are blowing against the pace and scale of development. Labor has promised to tear up the precincts plan if it wins the next state election, due in March 2019. The party positioned itself strongly against “over-development” in Kristina Keneally’s campaign for the federal seat of Bennelong, which covers middle-ring suburbs in the north-west. At the launch of her byelection campaign with Bill Shorten, Keneally twice referred to the Liberal state government having “presided over thousands of unit developments in this area”.

 As well as Sidoti, at least three Liberal MPs have expressed unhappiness at developments planned for their electorates. David Elliott, the member for Baulkham Hills in north-west Sydney, was so agitated by the plan for 8,200 new homes in Bella Vista and Castle Hill that he admitted using “unparliamentary terms” while making his case to the planning minister.

And the Greens have been at the forefront of opposition to many proposals for greater density. In a statement their NSW planning spokesman, David Shoebridge, painted an apocalyptic picture of the city’s future if present trends continued.

 “Soon cranes litter the skyline, trees are lost and block after block of cookie-cutter apartment blocks fill the horizons. There’ll be no investment in public infrastructure like schools, green space and public transport. There’ll be no place for kids to play, for people to exercise. You won’t be able to get a seat on the train, schools will be so overcrowded they’ll have to stagger play times.”

 Whether discontent will translate into more policy changes may become clearer as the election approaches. There are some straws in the wind, such as announcements that new schools will be built to accommodate the growing populations in Ultimo, Surry Hills and Green Square, which will become Sydney’s most densely populated suburb when the massive apartment complexes built there are filled. The huge unmet demand for schools was “essentially the result of assumptions on the part of state government that families with children wouldn’t live in apartments”, Easthope says. “Which were incorrect.”

 Olive says the election is the only realistic chance to halt the current strategy and move towards a plan for rail corridors that do not simply duplicate the pattern that brings all lines into the city. 

 “There needs to be a direct link between any priority planning precinct and new rail lines, services and corridors. The emphasis is on the new – not conversions … If they want to densify a suburb, they need to link it by new rail services, that’s the crucial nexus between a 30-minute city and planning.”

 Corinne Fisher says the government will be under increasing pressure to take the heat out of the protests by addressing the infrastructure deficit, particularly in light of its budget surplus and willingness to spend more than $2bn to knock down and rebuild Allianz and ANZ stadiums.

 “I think we’ll see some changes as the 2019 elections get closer,” Fisher says. “There’s absolutely no doubt that [overdevelopment] will be a major election issue and the NSW government has lost an incredible amount of credibility and trust among communities. It will have to address this issue. If it doesn’t, I would say that would have a very big impact on how people will vote.”

2021-11-11,GUARDIAN,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/26/opal-tower-cracks-nsw-government-urgent-investigation,2018-12-26,Sydney Opal Tower cracks: developer defends 'high-quality' building at Olympic Park | Sydney | The Guardian,"The developer of the Sydney high-rise that developed a crack on Christmas Eve has said the tower is still “a high-quality building” and the evacuation of residents only became a news story because “it happened over the Christmas break”.

Bassam Aflak, the director of developer Ecove, said the Opal Tower at Sydney Olympic Park was “absolutely” safe for residents and criticised “sensational” media reporting in a Boxing Day statement.

The brand new Opal Tower was evacuated on Monday night after residents heard loud noises and a crack developed on an internal wall on the 10th floor. The next day residents were allowed back into two-thirds of the building’s apartments, but residents of 51 units were still barred from re-entering their homes on Boxing Day.

Aflak said all units were safe to live in, but “a small number” were still being looked at.

“We understand the builders need clear access so they can investigate how to fix the problem,” he said. He added that “full liability” lay at the feet of the builder, Icon Construction.

“We understand the issue is with a concrete panel. Importantly, the authorities have deemed it safe for people to re-enter and they have isolated the issue to a small number of apartments.

An email sent to residents of the 51 units on Tuesday, seen by Guardian Australia, said any access to their apartments was prohibited “due to safety issues”.

Aflak said: “It’s a high-quality building. Ecove has delivered a project that is well above the industry standard. Until now it’s a project that’s gained attention because of its quality.

“The media has understandably investigated this as a sensational story but it’s happened over the Christmas break when there is a scarcity of people who can comment with authority.”

Michael Wu, whose apartment was one of the 51 affected, said he would move back in once it was given the all clear, but only temporarily.

“It was only meant to be a temporary place for me and my wife,” he told Guardian Australia. “We just got married and are looking for a new place. It will quicken the process of leaving the apartment. We were only going to live there for a year max. It’s just bad timing.”

Wu was having lunch near his home on Monday afternoon when the fault first appeared. His wife was trapped inside their apartment when the building shifted, which caused doors to stick in their frames.

Despite the experience, he said he trusted the block’s builders.

“I do my research. In my opinion, Icon are very good quality. I’ve seen some really shitty apartments but it gives me confidence that Icon are a big builder. They’re not small.

“Hopefully all the reports come through and it’s a minor thing in a support wall. That should be OK. If they come back and say it’s something major, I wouldn’t feel comfortable moving back in.

“[But] I think there will always be an element of fear there. Because you never know what’s going to happen.”

On Wednesday the New South Wales government announced an urgent investigation into whether the building complied with the state’s rules and regulations.

In his statement, Aflak said he was “stunned” by events.

“Icon, the builder has full liability on the design and construction of Opal Tower. The company is a well-established high-quality builder. We’ve all been stunned by what’s happened … We, like the residents, are anxious that the builder defines the problem and resolves it as soon as possible.”

An email to residents on Tuesday, seen by Guardian Australia, said a fault had developed from “ground floor to [floor] 35”. On Wednesday they were told Icon would be carrying out building works that day.

Icon has been contacted for comment.

The NSW Department of Planning said on Wednesday its investigation was already under way.

“The department’s compliance team was activated today and we are in touch with emergency services,” a spokesman told Guardian Australia. “The work has commenced, it will take what it takes.”

The planning minister, Anthony Roberts, promised he would make the report’s findings public.

“My heart goes out to those residents who have had their major investments – their homes – affected in such a way and the anxiety it is obviously causing,” he said.

The planning department will not necessarily examine the building’s structure, but will examine whether the conditions of consent for its development were met.

Opal Tower, built by developer Ecove, was completed this year. 

On Tuesday, residents received an email from the building’s strata managing agent that said 341 apartments were open.

“We have been notified by both Opal Tower’s building manager and the developer that two structural engineers approved the building safe for occupation and 341 apartments were reopened for resident access,” it said.

“Accommodation facilities have been arranged by Icon Constructions at both the Novotel and Ibis in Sydney Olympic Park at no cost to those 51 residents [still affected]”.

One resident, Samantha Lynn, told Channel Seven on Wednesday morning she was now looking for “somewhere else to live”.

“I don’t fully understand how one third of a building can be deemed unsafe – what does that mean for the other two thirds? I still don’t have the answers to that question. For me it’s about getting out as soon as possible and finding somewhere else to live.”

But the financial reality is that apartments are not as expensive so they might be a better bet for people who want to get on to the property ladder. House prices have jumped sharply in Sydney’s inner west, north-west and southern suburbs during the recent market rebound, according to recent figures from Domain, far outstripping units. Median house prices rose 4.8% in the September quarter; units 2.6%.

Units are also more plentiful. On Thursday the research company CoreLogic confirmed there aren’t many houses on the market. Things are better than they were in winter, but in Sydney total listings were still down 23% in November compared with a year ago. In Melbourne they are down 15.7% and in Perth 16.6%. Of the properties available in Sydney and Melbourne, almost half are units: 48.2% and 47.2% respectively.

Not surprisingly more people live in apartments than ever before. The 2016 census found about 10% of the population live in a unit. There is one occupied flat for every five houses, compared with seven back in 1991.

So if you’re thinking about taking the plunge in the apartment market but are worried about whether to buy old or new, building quality, cladding, strata or owner corporation fees and even ending up in a block full of Airbnb rentals, what should you look for?

The structural problems with the Opal and Mascot Towers in Sydney have been well publicised and have raised a lot of questions for people interested in buying new or recently built units.

Owners of apartments in the Mascot Towers block, which was evacuated in June when cracks appeared, faced the prospect of taking out huge loans to fix the problem as the New South Wales government considers recommendations to protect owners more effectively from substandard building practices.

In the meantime, there are two ways to check for basic information. One is through a seller’s certificate which in New South Wales will give some details of strata accounts, but it’s typically available only for people who have committed to buy. 

It’s far better to order a proper strata or body corporate inspection from professionals to find problems such as building defects, litigation issues, special levies that unit owners might be liable for over and above strata fees, and whether there’s enough money in the sink fund to pay for future repairs. These inspections will cost about $250 to $400. 

In Victoria it’s known as an owner’s corporation certificate and can be obtained on request. The cost depends on how quickly it is needed but starts at around $140 for delivery in 6-10 days. Tony Gerace, of real estate agent Burnhams in Footscray, Melbourne, where up to 4,000 new apartments are being built, said it was an essential step for buyers in Victoria. “Not everyone knows about this. But if it was me buying a unit, it would be the first thing I would do.”

This is important and should be flagged up by a strata or body corporate report. Strata fees are generally between about 0.3% and 0.7% of the property’s value, but can be up to 1.2% if it has facilities such as a gym, swimming pool or concierge. So while those add-ons may make the unit more attractive, they come with a price. “High fees can obviously be a drain on your cashflow, but can also be off-putting to future buyers so can stymie capital growth in your unit,” says Pete Wargent, a buyer’s agent in Sydney.

This remains a very serious issue in Australia and around the world after the Grenfell Tower disaster in London. Many high-rise developments in Australia have been built with flammable cladding. In Victoria the government is spending $600m to identify and fix the buildings. But in NSW the extent of the problem has been concealed from the public, so buyers have to find out for themselves if their building has the potentially lethal material. Adding to the sense of crisis, the Australian Institute of Building Surveyors said this week that the professional indemnity insurance market would collapse within 12 months because insurers will not cover builders and developers for cladding problems. It says the federal government has to step in and underwrite the industry.

Deregulation of the industry at state level has prevented a clearer system from developing, leaving people “buying blind”. Michael Teys, a strata law expert and academic at Deakin University who is researching due diligence issues, says he recently visited New Zealand to see how its system worked and was impressed.

“I was amazed by the transparency,” he says. “You get a complete record of the building, and it’s a really good system.

“But we don’t have that here in Australia and the information can be quite difficult to get. A lay person would struggle to get what they need so it’s madness to be buying and not have that check done by a professional.”

A study this year by Deakin showed that the number of building defects was growing, with water damage from leaking roofs and walls the most common. “Defects are endemic and are now the rule rather than the exception,” says Teys.

Yes. Start by checking if they’re still in business. There are many cases where a company might work on a building but fold when it’s completed, leaving no avenue for restitution if there are problems down the track. Steve Jovcevski, a property analyst at the consumer website Mozo, says it’s crucial to do due diligence in this area. “You’ve got to make sure who the builder is, who the developer is. Is the builder a tier one builder?” he says, meaning the biggest companies. “The bigger the builder, the less likely they are to go bust. If there are defects, they are more likely to be around to fix it.”

The same rules apply. Check out the developer and the builder. Since the building is still being built, this might be easier. You can go and see them at work. Off-the-plan deals also have the big advantage of saving a significant amount on stamp duty. The tax is payable only on the land value, rather than the home value, so it’s noticeably less. And in a rising market it can make sense because the unit might be worth more than you paid for it by the time you complete, typically two years after putting down a 10% deposit. However, prices can also come down and flats can be worth less than you paid.

Going for vintage will probably ensure that you don’t encounter too many serious structural problems, because enought time will have elapsed for any issues to come to light. Also older places tend to be low-level blocks built before the craze for high-rise living kicked in this century. Wargent also says that older places “tend to have a higher land value content per unit and more scarcity value than larger developments”. Older buildings are less likely to have underground parking and storage, although they may have attractive period features. They may also lack the large balconies of many new developments.

Ask around. These issues may have been raised at strata meetings. Otherwise try asking the agent or residents. Jovcevski says it’s important for the feel of the building to check the ratio of investors to owners: “You don’t want a place with a lot of Airbnb rentals. Some new developments around Central station in Sydney, for example, and Waterloo are well known for it and have a lot of student accommodation, so that might create a problem.” Conversely, if you want to rent your place out on Airbnb when you’re not at home, check with strata whether it’s allowed.

Just the obvious stuff. Get the contract checked by a solicitor or conveyancer, and check whether there are any developments planned that might change the ambience of the neighbourhood.

Some residents are still in temporary accommodation nearly two weeks after cracks were found in the Sydney Olympic Park building on Christmas Eve.

After a preliminary independent investigation confirmed a number of design and construction issues, residents returned on Saturday to find their homes “absolutely trashed”.

Pictures reveal one unit has had its ceiling and flooring torn away to allow equipment to prop up the concrete slabs separating each floor.

Beds, furniture and clothing were crudely piled near a window.

One woman told other residents in a social media group chat that her locks were changed, even though she provided a spare key to those working on her unit.

“It’s absolutely trashed,” she said in the chat. “We are so upset”

“This is horrific.”

Close to fifty units have been gutted and dozens more are also set to be torn apart, Seven News reported.

“We’re all very angry about this,” one resident said. “I mean, at least send us a notice or something. It’s just wrong for them to do things like this.”

Opal Tower builder Icon said it has kept the body corporate informed of their workers’ movements through the building, as requested. It said “a strict photographing” of apartments took place prior to investigation works and a second set of photos were taken when protection was laid out or furniture removed.

Referring to residents’ fridges being cleared out, an Icon spokeswoman said power had to be isolated to enable works so perishables were removed in the interests of residents.

She said residents would be able to claim back immediately the cost of losses.

“Only one resident has stated we cannot enter his apartment and we have complied,” the spokeswoman said. “No locks have been removed, however some were damaged by emergency services.”

Engineering experts Mark Hoffman and John Carter, who have been commissioned by the state government to conduct the independent investigation, said on Friday they had found no evidence of issues with the foundations of the building.

They said they needed further information before being able to comment on or address any proposed rectification plans. A final report is expected by Friday.

An emergency report into the cracked Opal Tower was completed in February by prominent university deans of architecture after the brand-new building was dramatically evacuated in December.

Five recommendations were handed down to improve building quality, reform certification and prevent it from happening again.

On Wednesday the government’s minister for better regulation, Kevin Anderson, said he had just released a discussion paper calling for “stakeholder input” on reforms that included many of the Opal recommendations.

But Engineers Australia say the changes are years overdue and were obvious before the cracks emerged in Opal Tower and in Mascot Towers this month.

The main recommendation of the Opal Tower report was to create an official registry of engineers who would then be used to provide independent third-party certification of designs and on-site inspections during construction.

Jonathan Russell from Engineers Australia said the recommendations from Opal Tower were in fact already recommended a year earlier – in February 2018.

“The Opal Tower recommendations of February 2019 are largely reflected in the Building Ministers Forum [BMF] report of a year earlier. This includes a recommendation to require engineers to be registered to practice.

“When calculating the time to take action, the starting point is February 2018, not February 2019,” he said. “The real question is if there has been any progress on implementing the BMF report recommendations of February 2018. And the answer is, not nearly enough.”

Russell said many members of the public assumed wrongly that the engineers register already existed.

“The general public and home investors have simply assumed that engineers must be registered to practice in NSW. That is not the case – anyone can call themselves an engineer.”

Mehreen Faruqi, a federal Greens senator for NSW and former civil engineer, said the registry was “common sense” and “should have been done years ago”.

“These reforms are urgently needed. As a professional civil engineer, I think it is pretty ridiculous we still have a situation where there is no register.

“Engineering associations have been calling for things like a registry of qualified engineers for years.”

The Opal Tower report in February also made other recommendations: the creation of an open repository for certifications (“to raise the accountability of certification processes”) and the creation of a Building Structure Review Board.

On Wednesday, Anderson said the government was “committed to getting important reforms right”.

The discussion paper, called Building Stronger Foundations, contained four reforms.

As well as the registry of engineers, it floats the introduction of an industry-wide duty of care, which would allow a homeowner to seek compensation if a building developer or builder had been negligent, and the appointment of a building commissioner.

A duty of care had previously been recommended by the Owners Corporation Network, who advocate for homebuyers.

“The problem with building is that it is not always clear who owes a duty of care to who,” their chairman Phillip Gall told Guardian Australia earlier in June.

Anderson said people now had the “opportunity to provide feedback” to the ideas.

“The legislation will implement many of the recommendations from the Lambert and Shergold-Weir reports into the building industry, and now we want to hear from industry and the wider community to help finalise the legislation.

“We are committed to getting these important reforms right and ensuring they are developed in close consultation with the industry and community.”

The news prompted a frustrated response from one resident, who interrupted a press conference on Thursday afternoon to complain about once again having to leave their apartment to be relocated to a hotel.

Opal Tower in Sydney’s Olympic Park was evacuated on Monday night after a crack developed in a load-bearing concrete panel and the building shifted 2mm – causing plaster to crack and doors to stick in their frames.

On Tuesday the building was declared safe to live in by its developer, Ecove, and residents of two-thirds of the tower were told they could return to their apartments.

On Boxing Day Ecove’s director hit back at “sensational” reports, declaring that Opal Tower was a “high-quality” building and that the company that built the tower, Icon Constructions, was “a well-established, high-quality builder”.

But on Thursday afternoon Icon announced all residents would now be relocated from the building so the entire site could be investigated and repaired.

All residents would be moved within 24 hours and the work could take up to 10 days, a spokeswoman said.

But the company stressed that the building was still structurally sound and no residents were in danger.

“The temporary relocation is a precautionary measure to allow engineers to work around the clock to investigate and remediate the site in the quickest time possible,” a statement said.

At a press conference held at the foot of the building, Icon’s managing director, Nick Brown, rejected the claim that the building “will never be safe”.

Guy Templeton, an engineer from firm WSP who are providing support to Icon, said the structure was sound.

“I’m very comfortable standing right here, below the building,” he told reporters. “[But] the reasons for the failure at the moment are unknown.”

Brown said there was no cracking in any other part of the building, but a similar pre-cast concrete panel was used in 16 other locations.

“This wasn’t a rush job,” he said. “I think we will continue to be the reputable builder that we are.”

But he was then interrupted by an angry resident, who accused the company of mistreating them.

“You ask us to move back, now you ask us to evacuate again?” she asked. “We have pets, we have valuables in our apartments, it’s impossible and the accommodation … is really terrible compared to our apartments, which we paid for.”

“Can we have some fair treatment in the end?” she asked.

Brown said Icon was “spending a lot of time and energy of a team of the country’s best engineers” and that the investigation would also be overseen by independent engineers hired by the body corporate.

Among other projects, Icon have built offices for the Victorian parliament, a molecular science building for Melbourne University, and the Ruth Everuss Aquatic Centre in Sydney.

Since Tuesday morning most residents of Opal Tower’s 390 apartments have been allowed to return home. But 51 units, located in one corner of the building, were still blocked off.

Dave, a resident of Opal Tower, told Guardian Australia it was frustrating that the cause of the fault still had not been fully explained.

“I guess it’s good having some sort of time frame, but they haven’t really explained properly what the exact issue was which caused the damage in the first place,” he said.

On Tuesday, Dave said he had been given five minutes to return and collect his belongings.

“My apartment and my neighbour had notices on the doors that said you can’t actually live in here,” he said. “Nobody else was affected, it was just that corner.”

Icon said all affected residents would be compensated for the disruption.

Also on Thursday, the New South Wales planning minister, Anthony Roberts, announced that two engineering professors would lead an investigation into what had happened to the building.

Earlier experts had said problems with apartments like Opal Tower had been “brewing for a long time” owing to a poor compliance system in New South Wales, overdevelopment and a “she’ll be right” attitude to construction.

But Bassam Aflak, Ecove’s director, rejected this: “Any suggestion the building damage pointed to ‘a broader pattern in the industry’ is completely wrong. The city’s ‘development boom’ has not led to cutting of corners. There has been no cutting of corners.

“It’s too early to leap to any conclusions, for instance, to speculate on wider building issues because of what appears to be one failed panel.”

Aflak also said on Wednesday that the evacuation had only made news because it occurred during Christmas.

“The media has understandably investigated this as a sensational story but it’s happened over the Christmas break when there is a scarcity of people who can comment with authority,” he said.

On Friday evening, the company that built Opal Tower, Icon Constructions, announced that residents would remain in hotels for another seven days – despite promising last week that they could return by Monday.

Also on Friday, the spokeswoman for the Australian Subcontractors Association, Louise Stewart, said a “toxic culture” had developed where subcontractors were forced to work for unreasonable rates and asked to do extra unpaid work, which created low-quality buildings.

Opal Tower, a new apartment building in Sydney’s Olympic Park, developed a large crack on Christmas Eve. Further faults were later discovered and the New South Wales government has announced an emergency investigation.

However, the developer and builder have said the tower is safe, structurally sound and poses no threat to safety.

Stewart said the faults highlighted how subcontractors across the industry were expected to work for rates that were “too competitive”.

“The subcontractors are asked to price jobs at the tender stage and even if the work is won, the prices are then shopped around and they are expected to drop their rates,” she said. “It’s the nature of the industry, that’s the way it’s been working for years and it’s part of the problem.

“[Builders] might come back and say ‘You need to drop it by 10%’. Subcontractors will price a job at fair market value and then they get completely screwed down by the builder.

“The subcontractors are also asked to do extra work that is outside the scope of the price. And if you know you are not getting paid for it, you are not going to do your best work.”

Stewart said subcontractors made up 82% of the building industry, resulting in an increasingly competitive market.

“Fifty years ago, builders employed large workforces and the trades were employed by the builder. Now almost none of the trades are employed by the builder. They are all subcontractors. And the subcontractors are played off against each other to get the lowest price.

“It’s destroying the industry,” she said. “It’s eroding the quality of projects.”

A spokeswoman for Icon rejected the claim that it used too many subcontractors.

She said Icon used a “very small percentage” of subcontractors, well below the industry-wide figure of 82% cited by Stewart.

“Icon was very happy with the contract price that was awarded, of which a very small component was for subcontractor works,” she said.

Icon said it did not ask subcontractors to do too much extra work – known as variations.

“In terms of variations, there was no greater or less number of variations [than] on any standard build of this kind,” the spokeswoman said.

On Friday, the NSW planning minister, Anthony Roberts, announced the results of an “interim briefing” he had received from the two professors of engineering commissioned to investigate the Opal Tower fault.

“We can say from our initial assessment there is no evidence of any issues with the foundations of the building, though we believe that there are a number of design and construction issues that require further investigation,” they said.

The review is being led by Mark Hoffman from the University of New South Wales and John Carter from the University of Newcastle.

Roberts said he did not believe any residents should be moved back into the building until an “initial report” had been completed by the professors.

Later on Friday, Icon announced it was taking this advice.

“Accordingly, Icon advises that it has secured ongoing hotel accommodation for residents until next Friday, 11 January,” a statement said. “We are hopeful that the independent investigator’s initial report will be made available in the course of the next week.”

On 27 December, Icon had told residents they could move back into their apartments within 10 days – that is, by Monday.

But on 1 January, the builder announced that more cracks had been found on another level, and those affected could not move back in until those cracks were repaired. 

The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, told the tower’s residents they should “absolutely” look into legal action against the developer, Ecove, and the builder. “I would if I was in their shoes,” she said.
