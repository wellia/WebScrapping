And experts say the nightmare facing residents of Mascot Towers won’t be the last.

The building was evacuated last Friday night due to serious concerns regarding cracks in the primary support structure and facade masonry.

Soon after, Australian economist John Adams, Digital Finance Analytics founder Martin North and property consultant Edwin Almeida claimed Australia was full of “high-rise death traps” in a discussion uploaded to YouTube.

Since the Mascot Towers story broke, news.com.au has also received unconfirmed reports of similar faults in other residential towers in Sydney.

But according to Owners Corporation Network spokesman Stephen Goddard, these incidents could be just the tip of the iceberg.

He said the problem was probably far greater than most people realised because many owners within faulty buildings did not want that information to be made public, as they feared being “stigmatised like Mascot and Opal”, which would cause their building “to become toxic” — and lose value.

“The only reason we hear about Opal and Mascot is because the defects are life-threatening, but the majority of defects are water penetration and the absence of fire safety — and those issues are being quietly dealt with,” he said.

“All over the country, people are trying to prevent their buildings from becoming toxic and losing capital values. 

“The reason why you have difficulty finding these buildings is because they’re hiding — (the owners) don’t want talk to you.”

He said he knew of at least one other building in the city with an exterior that was “falling into the street”.

Mr Goddard said when a building was found to be faulty, the owners’ corporation was often accused of failing to properly maintain it — although he said that didn’t stand up in the case of the Opal and Mascot towers, as both were relatively new.

He said it was now “desperation time” — and architects, builders and engineers needed to be held accountable and follow a strict code of conduct, while owners’ corporations must be allowed to sue in cases of negligence.

“Retrofitting (a building’s) structural stability can cost millions — it tends to cost six to 10 times the cost of doing it properly the first time,” he said.

“The Mascot Towers owners are looking at significant special levies of anywhere between $100,000 to $300,000 per lot — there are going to be big levies that people will have to pay in circumstances where a building is so toxic their apartment is unsaleable.

“We’ve got owners looking down the barrel at special levies they may not be able to afford. They could have to move out and could well default on their mortgage. They won’t be able to sell their lot, so they will have to commence bankruptcy proceedings, all because they wanted a piece of the Australian dream.”

Unfortunately, Mr Goddard is not alone in his concern over Australia’s faulty building epidemic.

Real estate expert and Starr Partners CEO Douglas Driscoll has also previously warned of the country’s potential problem with “vertical ghettos” — poorly-constructed apartment towers built during the property boom that he expects will develop faults in the near future.

While he stressed these buildings were in the clear minority, with the overwhelming majority constructed by reputable developers to a very high quality, he said issues like those at Mascot and Opal towers would increase.

“We’ve got to accept Mascot Towers was not the first, and it won’t be the last,” he said.

“Three years ago I wrote about the need for more stringent regulation around building quality in Australia. 

“We can’t take risks when it comes to people’s lives, and if it means developers need to jump through a few more hoops, if it helps saves lives in the long term, surely we should all be for that.”

He said “99 per cent” of residential high rises and unit blocks were built to a “very high standard”, but the recent property boom had led to a number of “pseudo-developers” essentially “cashing in”.

“(Those developers) don’t have the level of expertise of some of the more established developers and sometimes the buildings reflect that — they weren’t building to last, they were building for profit,” he said.

Mr Driscoll said news of the Mascot Towers issue hadn’t surprised him, and he expected similar issues to happen again in the near future.

“I think it’s potentially an insight into what we will see more of in future — unfortunately, it will crop up time and time again,” he said.

“The residents of Mascot Towers are essentially homeless, so what happens to those people who are now out of pocket? Should they be compensated, and if so, who pays? Unfortunately, this issue will rear its ugly head again, there’s no question about that.”

He said we needed to stop “playing Russian roulette with people’s safety”, and tighter regulation was needed.

He called for a full, thorough review of current building regulations — or possibly a royal commission — and said the building industry should echo that of the automotive industry, with the introduction of annual building safety checks similar to a pink slip and longer warranty periods to cover major defects.

At the moment, the warranty period is just six years in NSW, and Mr Driscoll said that should be extended and made uniform across the country.

11/11/2021,news.com.au,https://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/buying/company-behind-opal-tower-fiasco-caught-up-in-new-building-defect-row/news-story/b356707b79f507a377b339a71a5b2f22,9/10/2019,Company behind Opal Tower fiasco caught up in new building defect row,"Residents of yet another Sydney apartment block have been rocked by alarming safety fears — this time allegedly involving their balconies. 

According to a bombshell report by The New Daily, occupants of the Otto Rosebery complex in the NSW capital’s southeast have recently been issued “urgent” instructions.

In a safety letter seen by the publication, residents of the tower’s 298 units have been told not to lean on their balconies, allow children to play on them or to let more than three people on them at a time.

The warning comes after an investigation allegedly revealed the block’s balustrades were “structurally defective” and of “inadequate strength”.

And in another twist, the company behind the four-year-old complex is none other than Icon Co — the same embattled operation responsible for the Opal Tower debacle, which saw residents evacuated from the newly constructed building after serious cracks developed just before Christmas last year.

According to The New Daily, warning letters have since been stuck to Otto’s balcony doors, and a strata management note has told occupants “all possible precautions should be taken to avoid purposeful or accidental leaning”.

The publication claimed owners were considering legal action in the Supreme Court. 

An Icon spokeswoman told news.com.au it was working with relevant parties to resolve the situation.

“The Otto Rosebery apartment complex has been fully certified by an independent engineer and witnessed by the Accredited Certifier as part of the occupation certification process,” the spokeswoman said.

“The approval included both the structure and the balustrade, with no safety issues identified. 

“Icon is committed to working with all parties involved to ensure the ongoing integrity of the apartment complex and is currently working with the Owners Corporation to obtain access to the property so additional testing can be conducted. 

“Icon is ready to commence the validation process as early as tomorrow to help resolve the situation as quickly as possible.

“All parties agree the safety of residents remains the number one priority. Icon and the Owners Corporation continue to work constructively on this matter.”

However, it is just the latest of a string of concerning issues plaguing Sydney apartment towers.

The Opal Tower scandal dominated headlines over the Christmas holidays and into the new year, and within months a new residential tower block defect had emerged, after Mascot Towers in inner Sydney was also evacuated over potentially devastating cracks.

In July, Melbourne’s Australia 108 complex was also hit by movement and cracking sounds, while scores of owners were prevented from moving into their brand new apartments in Erskineville in Sydney’s inner west as it was feared they may have been constructed on contaminated ground. 

Earlier this year, Owners Corporation Network spokesman Stephen Goddard told news.com.au he believed those incidents could be just the tip of the iceberg, and warned more building defects were likely to emerge.

“This is yet another example of systemic failure in the building industry to deliver the building code in residential strata,” he told news.com.au in the wake of the latest situation.

“It is an unavoidable truth we suffer systemic failure, so this comes as no surprise.

“One was an event, two was extraordinary, three is a trend — and what do you call four? An unavoidable truth.”

A number of experts have called for a thorough investigation into Australia’s building industry, with Labor MP for Heffron Ron Hoenig and Starr Partners CEO Douglas Driscoll both calling for a potential royal commission. 

In NSW, defective buildings are covered by warranty for just six years after a development has been completed.

However, as Otto Rosebery is only four years old, residents will likely have grounds to recoup any losses if faults are found.

Scaffolding will cloak sections of the prestigious Yve Apartments — once awarded the state’s top architecture prize — for more than a year.

One resident contacted the Herald Sun to complain the curvy, shimmering St Kilda Rd complex had become “an ugly fortress”.

“We’re living on a construction site,” said the resident, who declined to be named.

“The scaffolding is working its way up and around the building. It’s a gilded cage. It’s not a very pleasant place to live.

“You’ve got people paying big money for views and you can’t even see out the ­windows.”

Another resident told the Herald Sun some of his cashed-up neighbours were relocating to holiday homes or travelling overseas to escape the worst of the construction disruption.

Celebrity owners in the complex are believed to include tennis star Lleyton ­Hewitt and online retail ­entrepreneur Ruslan Kogan.

Works to fix problems ­affecting almost all of the 210 apartments started in late January, with the first of four stages nearing completion.

The Owners Corporation originally sought a $22.5 million payout from the developers, Sunland Group, over the alleged defects but ultimately settled a tribunal case for about $7 million.

Tribunal documents allege problems including poor balcony drainage, and rusting on some balustrading.

Yve Apartments Owners’ Corporation chairman Robert Edge said there was “no doubt the project is causing some inconvenience”.

But he stressed the repairs had been well-administered and carefully communicated and said he was confident owners and residents would be pleased with the end result.

“All being well, we’ll be ­finished in 12 months … and everything will be fantastic,” he said.

A spokeswoman for the Sunland Group said she was legally unable to comment.

Documents reveal the developer agreed to settle “without any admission of liability”.

Defence documents filed by the developer’s lawyers claimed most of the alleged problems were aesthetic and didn’t compromise structural integrity.

A “tsunami of residential apartment construction” in the inner city has caused prices for apartments to stagnate.

Experts warn that an increase in building defects and concerns over cladding could make apartments even harder to sell.

Owners could lost money in many high-density developments, research by Propertyology shows.

Propertyology head of research Simon Pressley said the price growth gap between houses and high-density apartments in blue-chip suburbs was “appalling”. 

The difference in price rises between houses and apartments was most stark in Abbotsford (88 per cent gap), South Yarra (73 per cent) and Parkville (79 per cent) in the past decade. 

Melbourne’s overall price growth differentials were the largest in any Australian city. 

“Being centrally located, in a trendy area, being close to a train station, or having a stylish fit-out means absolutely nothing from a capital growth perspective if there are thousands of same-same Lego properties for buyers to choose from,” Mr Pressley said. 

Advantage Property Consulting director Frank Valentic said first-home buyers should consider looking farther out of the city to avoid the issue. 

“Try and buy units about a 10-15km radius from the city, where there’s not as much high-rise development,” Mr Valentic said. 

“Stick to the older-style blocks from the 1930s to 1970s that tend to be in smaller developments and have more land value.”

He added that building defects, including cladding, already affected returns for vendors who bought into dodgy buildings. 

Mr Pressley said the growing uncertainty about the quality of new high-rises would also reduce the buyer pool. 

Homeowners Rob and Christine McEwan chose to purchase a three-bedroom property in Seaford, rather than an apartment in the inner city. 

“We wanted to live near Rob’s parents in Elwood and also close to the beach, but when we started looking down the Nepean Highway we realised Seaford was the closest suburb where we could afford for a house,” Mrs McEwan said. 

“Now that we’ve started a family we can stay in our three-bedroom house, which also has a backyard, a lot longer than we could have in an apartment.” 

The QBE Housing Outlook report shows Melbourne unit prices are forecast to drop by 0.7 per cent to $545,000 in the next 12 months. Houses are expected to slightly increase in price by 0.1 per cent to a $772,000 median.

11/11/2021,news.com.au,https://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/sydney-nsw/changes-to-home-building-laws-could-leave-strata-owners-stranded/news-story/34285f5090a6e242b2ce579852693632,14/01/2015,Changes to home building laws could leave strata owners stranded,"Changes to home building laws that are meant to reduce “red tape” and give NSW consumers greater protection could leave residential strata owners facing reduced rights according to an industry body.

A Strata Community Australia spokesman said the new laws, which come into effect today mean many apartment owners may not have the consumer protections they need. 

Greg Haywood, SCA NSW president, said some protections for strata owners were being scaled back and as the body representing those living and working in strata in NSW he said it was important that SCA NSW speaks out.

“It’s a fact of life that new buildings often have defects. Some are serious and others not so much but regardless of the seriousness the builder will still be required to return and fix them,” he said.

He said that in a situation where the builder has disappeared, gone bankrupt, or just can’t be found, consumers have some protection which would enable them to bring a claim and allow them to rectify any construction problems. 

“The issue is that under the current laws owners had a certain period of time in which to lodge a claim or commence proceedings if they were unable to get their builder to fix the problem. But now the new laws will apply retrospectively to reduce the time and nature of some claims,” Mr Haywood said.

However, NSW Fair Trading Minister, Matthew Mason-Cox said NSW consumers will have greater protection from shoddy construction work from today.

“Last year, the NSW Government announced several significant changes to the home building laws aimed at modernising practices in the industry, increasing confidence in the sector, and strengthen consumer protection,” Mr Mason-Cox said.

“From today, builders and traders face up to 12 months in prison if they are repeat offenders of unlicensed contracting work or don’t have the required insurance,” he said.

Mr Mason-Cox also said that licence eligibility has been tightened to stamp out illegal “phoenixing” (where a company closes down leaving large unpaid debts, only to re-emerge as a new company trading under a different name).

“At its core, these new home building laws are about ensuring NSW consumers are appropriately protected without creating unnecessary red tape and regulation that will stifle industry growth and investment,’’ he said. 

As part of the changes, minor residential work worth under $5000 can now be carried out without a licence. 

“This will reduce ‘red tape’ for consumers who want to get minor work done around their properties, and assists builders,’’ Mr Mason-Cox said, adding that the amendment would bring NSW into line with Victoria, WA and Tasmania. 

Mr Mason-Cox said “we believe these new reforms respond to the changing landscape of the NSW residential housing market, as well as bring the home building laws into the 21 century.’’

Some parts of the Amendment Act will come into effect on 1 March 2015, giving builders and industry time to make the transition to new requirements. 

SCA NSW is advising residential strata owners to:

• Determine how the new amendments will affect their building as not all buildings are affected.

• Ensure they lodge any home warranty insurance claims they can make as soon as possible before the new changes take effect — this will preserve their existing rights.

• Start any claims against their builders and developers in the Courts and NCAT before the changes occur to preserve their existing rights.

• Give priority to entering into a building rectification work contracts as soon as possible (also before the new legislation commences).
