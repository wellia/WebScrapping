wreaks havoc on Australian weather patterns, data published by Suncorp Insurance shows 46 per cent of Australians aren’t thinking about natural disasters when buying a new home or renovating.The survey of 1195 Australians shows just one in four have modified their homes to protect from floods, bushfires and cyclones.Suncorp’s executive manager Bernadette Norrie said Australians are exposing themselves to the financial, physical and mental toll that property damage from natural disasters can cause.“It’s a real disruption,” she said.“You often have to leave your home while repairs take place, and you lose irreplaceable and sentimental items.”Luckily, experts say home buyers can make their homes more resilient once they work out which natural disasters could affect their property.They can trim trees, move electric wires or landscape their garden.Here’s how to check whether a home is resilient and what to do when it’s not.Step one: Location and riskBefore starting any renovations or buying a property, you need to find out what types of extreme weather events are likely to occur in the area.Suncorp’s data shows many Australians don’t research factors such as elevation, weather history and coastal proximity when house hunting.But these factors are crucial to working out how exposed a property is and could even affect your ability to secure a home loan, according to Curtin University property lecturer J-Han Ho.“People don’t realise that every home loan by any major … bank or credit union requires your property to be fully insured,” he said.However, insurance companies are reluctant to provide insurance for properties vulnerable to natural disasters and may only do so at inflated prices, he said.ElevationThe first factor to think about is the elevation of the property, Dr Ho said.Bushfires tend to burn faster as they move uphill, while lower elevation makes a home more vulnerable to erosion and flooding.And although Australians love living near beaches and rivers, Dr Ho said buying too close to the water is “really risky” amid rising sea levels.Old properties in cities like Fremantle are already using underground pumps “24/7” to pump away ocean water, he said.“You can easily find the elevation of the property on the local council’s [online] Intramaps [and] Google Maps.”Dr Ho said you should also look at a floodplain map, available on state and territory government websites, to find out how often an area is flooded.You can find the relevant floodplain maps here:Western AustraliaSouth AustraliaNorthern TerritoryTasmaniaQueenslandAustralian Capital TerritoryVictoriaNew South WalesWind speedsAnother thing to consider is how exposed a property is to damage from high winds and cyclones.Dr Ho said only properties in Queensland and Western Australia are usually built to withstand winds over 317km/h, while homes built elsewhere can usually only withstand winds at about 130km/h.Dr Ho said even properties in coastal cities outside of the northern region should be built with cyclone-proof designs.You can check the wind speeds in your area on this website.Step two: Property upgradesOnce you understand the natural disaster risks facing a property, you can make it more resilient.Dr Ho said preventative measures are less about cost and more about protecting your family.“Prevention is normally better than repair,” he said.For existing home owners or people looking to build, here are a few ways to protect a property.To prevent fire damage:Landscape smart : Dr Ho said if there are plants and vegetation nearby you are essentially in a bushfire zone. You can divert a bushfire away from your home by trimming trees and getting rid of vegetation that could act as fuel for the fireSwitch out metal for plastic fittings: Ms Norrie said PVC plastic gusset fittings will melt if there’s a fire. This will make gutters fall and consequently reduce the risk of embers entering your home or water supplyInvest in non-combustible building materials: Ms Norrie recommended external finishings such as core filled blocks and aerated concrete cladding. She also said glazed windows and doors can prevent heat-induced crackingInstall a dual-tank water system: In high bushfire-risk areas, Ms Norrie said having two separate water tanks is important; one for firefighting, and the other as a back-up water supply.To prevent water damage:Lift your electrics: Ms Norrie said installing electrical wiring in roofs and making sure your light switches and power points are at least a metre off the ground will reduce the risk of electrical issues during floodingInvest in waterproof interior insulation: Ms Norrie said waterproof interior wall linings can be removed when wet, then reused once the wall cavity has dried outUpgrade roof gutters: Dr Ho said rainfalls are getting “heavier and more intense”, so some gutters on older houses are now too small. He said you can get slotted gutters or drill holes towards to the top of the sides of your gutters to keep water out of your house.To prevent wind damage:Strap down your roof to your home’s concrete baseUse cyclone-rated outdoor storage to prevent flying debris.",N,,,

They potentially arrived, or were woken in the cool of the night, to find their smoke alarm incessantly beeping given the battery had neared the end of its life during the extended regional lockout. But that's not the only pressing issue for holiday home landlords. There was an ill-timed November 1 deadline for all short term and holiday rental properties to register with the state government's registration scheme. Thousands of non-registered short-term rentals are now being suspended from major accommodation platforms, like Airbnb and Stayz, just as regional tourism revenue resumes. The timing was a dopey decision by state government minister Rob Stokes, that will see landlords lose the prospect of fresh bookings in what has been an ailing $30 billion industry, impacted by bush fire and Covid hits to revenue. Two weeks before the November 1 deadline there were 12,000 holiday home registrations with the NSW government which had jumped to 26,000 by last Monday – still well short of the estimated 80,000 short-term rental properties across Sydney and the regions. There is always doubt on total holiday home and short term accommodation numbers. Especially now as after the regional property boom, plus lockdown, many rentals may have quit the rental pool, being used permanently by their owners, or sold to owner occupiers departing Sydney for good. The new rules for short-term rental accommodation (STRA) providers require all NSW holiday homeowners to register their property before it is rented. They must pay a $65 fee via the NSW Planning Portal, and once they have completed registration, owners will be issued with an STRA Property ID number, which must be displayed on online property listing websites. The new rules follow a 2019 discussion paper, stemming from a parliamentary inquiry into the Adequacy of the Regulation of Short-term Holiday Letting in NSW. It came about in part from concerns over inconsiderate or anti-social behaviour of guests, which now sees an exclusion register kept by Fair Trading with a “two strikes and you're out” policy with any landlord or occupant breaching noise rules being banned. The state government has taken the review to regulate the previously unregulated industry. The new system will see the introduction in some local government areas, including Ballina, Dubbo and Bega Valley, of 180 nightly maximum stays with the register set to capture the number of days a property is used, allowing for monitoring of any such rental limits. All registered rental homes have until 1 March next year to meet fire safety requirements, including evacuation diagrams, fire alarms, fire blankets in kitchens, extinguishers, evacuation area, and emergency contacts. Holiday homes must also have a Covid-safe plan in place. Originally published as Short-term rental accommodation: Ailing tourism industry and holiday-makers brace for fresh pain",N,,,

Well, how long is a piece of string?”Dr Ho said regulations differ between states and territories, but generally there is no way for people to back out of a sale once a deal is settled if they only have buyer’s remorse.Builders Collective of Australia president Phil Dwyer said some people might spend more time researching a $300 air fryer than a house worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.He said the builder’s warranty is “next to useless” because it is only available to the buyer when the builder has died, has disappeared, is deregistered, or becomes insolvent.A statutory warranty lasts for 10 years but only applies to structural defects, with smaller issues that may seem serious to the buyer not covered, Mr Dwyer said.If you feel aspects of a property were misrepresented before you bought it, “justice comes at a huge price”.“I know of cases where [each side has paid] over $100,000 … to fight an issue over $20,000 or $30,000,” Mr Dwyer said.ME Bank data showed 18 per cent of people who found issues with their homes after buying them had been “impatient and concerned by rising prices”.“That type of approach … is not a good thing with such a significant purchase,” Mr Dwyer said.“I’d rather miss out than buy a property that’s got a lot of problems, because even the rising market’s not going to save you [if there are issues].”What to look out for when inspecting a propertyDr Ho said buyers willing to do proper research have access to plenty of online resources.He said many councils have interactive mapping that can measure the size of a property and provide a “legal description” of the property.Dr Ho said if you order a title search, the certificate title can give you legal information on the property, such as whether it has easements, restrictions, benefits or liabilities.“A lot of times people … don’t even know that they’re buying a strata property versus a green title property,” he said.Dr Ho also said you should check whether the property is listed on a website of contaminated sites, and ask the water corporations whether the property had any building restrictions due to underground sewage or water pipes.Dr Ho and Mr Dwyer said it’s always important to hire a building inspector, which normally costs a few hundred dollars.But they also gave TND a list of the top things buyers should be aware of when inspecting a house:Roof structure: If there is sagging visible from outside or inside the house, the beams may have to be replaced. Together with replacing the roof and tiling, this could cost up to $100,000Water leakage: If you can see the roof is sagging inside the house or if plaster is “powdering off the wall” this could indicate water leakage. To get a “rough” idea as to whether there is water leakage in a wall, Dr Ho said select a wall near a bathroom or kitchen, and touch it about one-and-a-half to two metres off the ground. Then slide your hands down the wall; if the wall starts to get cooler, that indicates moisture in the wallElectrical wiring: Dr Ho said a property’s age and location is important, because each state and territory brought in electrical licensing regulations at different times. Also, if your electrical wiring is more than 30 years old, things like rubber conduits and insulation might be brittle and need replacingCracks in walls: Mr Dwyer said cracks in plaster or bricks, particularly extending from doors and windows, are a concern.

That's because the real housing affordability pressures experienced by low-income renters and aspiring home owners will never be addressed by the private market alone regardless of whether we continue to impose expectations about the location, quality, and impact of new housing.

State and local planning systems need to continue to zone land for housing development, deliver timely decisions and ensure the infrastructure – from utilities to transport, schools, hospitals, and green space – supports new development.

It's stuck because it makes intuitive sense – simple supply and demand. We're all familiar with the basics of supply and demand; when the supply of a product – such as bananas – goes down, prices go up, and vice versa. Of course, the housing market is different — in my household, when bananas are expensive, we switch to pears or mandarins — but we can't as easily substitute our housing needs. Industry groups, politicians, and others ignore these differences and refuse to consider structural solutions to Australia's housing problems. It's easier to blame planning regulation and a lack of new supply. But it takes heroic conviction to argue a lack of supply is our housing problem when Australia's population growth has made a reverse turn. Over the past two years net overseas migration has fallen into negative territory, yet house prices, propelled by low interest rates and government grants, have continued their stratospheric rise. Between March 2020-2021, Australia's population growth fell from 1.5 per cent to a mere 0.1 per cent, due to a net overseas migration loss of 95,300 people. Yet by June 2021, house prices had risen by almost 17 per cent. Would “reforming” state and local planning systems arrest this price growth? Supply “splainers” argue that new construction is the only way to cool prices, and that planning rules are the only constraint on construction. They point to zoning, height and density controls as examples of this constraint. Often, they draw on studies from the United States or the United Kingdom (where planning systems are very different and local governments are more powerful) as “evidence” of the impact of planning on Australia's housing markets. The problem is that none of these commentators refer to actual data on the ways in which Australian planning systems operate, or how land developers and property owners behave. In Australia, where the states and territories have consistently overruled local concerns about new and higher density developments, record numbers of new homes have been delivered over the past five years. In Greater Sydney, housing completions have more than doubled over the past decade, rising from less than 15,000 per year in 2010-2011 to nearly 43,000 by 2018-19; almost 30,000 of which were multi-unit developments. Further, in calling for planning reform, commentators betray their ignorance of the waves of reform that have been enacted over the past 20 years, largely in the name of housing affordability. Sydneysiders will still remember the infamous 2005 “Part 3A” Major Projects reform which granted sweeping “concept” approval for large residential developments – the industry was calling for its abolition by 2011. Research by Dr Catherine Gilbert and I found that of the 39,600 dwellings proposed under this scheme, 37,537 were approved, although by 2016, less than half of these had been delivered by developers. Less sensational reforms in NSW have also ensued. For instance, professional experts have replaced elected decision-makers in determining developments; local land use plans must now accommodate long-range housing supply targets; and compliant housing applications are determined via codes and private certifiers. Whatever you think about these reforms, they've neither held back new housing development nor demonstrably improved housing affordability. That's because the real housing affordability pressures experienced by low-income renters and aspiring home owners will never be addressed by the private market alone regardless of whether we continue to impose expectations about the location, quality, and impact of new housing. Lockdown has delivered a crucial reminder of the importance of housing design for health and wellbeing, while the looming impacts of climate change make it imperative to maintain and improve rules about where and how we construct new homes. Unfettered construction may undermine quality and climate resilience, but it won't solve affordability. At best, price growth may moderate but new controls on lending and the likelihood of future interest hikes will already cause prices to plateau. This won't do much for aspiring owners currently unable to meet the deposit gap or qualify for a loan, nor address the needs of lower income renters. Even a sudden glut of housing supply won't resolve affordability, marginal borrowers can't secure loans in a collapsing market. Meanwhile, competition for lower cost rental accommodation remains intense. Economist We do need new housing supply as our population grows and changes, in fact, it's critical. State and local planning systems need to continue to zone land for housing development, deliver timely decisions and ensure the infrastructure – from utilities to transport, schools, hospitals, and green space – supports new development. However, new supply alone is not enough. To address affordability, we need to reboot the social and affordable housing supply programs that delivered over 10 per cent of new homes all the way through to the mid 1990s. We need Commonwealth and state governments to support non-profit and community housing schemes as well as shred equity models for aspiring first home buyers. We need to stop talking supply slogans and start talking genuine housing solutions.

We do import some bricks from overseas, which tend to be high-end, artistic-style products, and shortages are fairly common, even in a normal year.

A key component of the council's new 10-year Ipswich Resource Recovery Strategy was allowing glass to be put back in yellow-tip bins after it was banned in 2018.

The city's new strategy has set goals to reduce its generation of household waste by 25 per cent, divert waste from landfill by a total of 95 per cent and increase recycling of local waste by 70 per cent – all by 2050.

The council intends to build a brand new recycling and refuse centre by 2025 The State Government's waste levy, introduced in 2019, is $85 per tonne for general household waste but offset by a rebate paid by the government to the council to protect ratepayers.

A key component of the council's new 10-year Ipswich Resource Recovery Strategy was allowing glass to be put back in yellow-tip bins after it was banned in 2018. The council will ramp up a promotional campaign as part of efforts to meet bold targets. Ipswich generated 107,700 tonnes of rubbish during the 2019-20 financial year, with just under a quarter of that able to be recycled. By 2031, the amount of waste thrown out by residents a year in the fastest-growing city in Queensland is expected to be more than 175,000 tonnes. The city's new strategy has set goals to reduce its generation of household waste by 25 per cent, divert waste from landfill by a total of 95 per cent and increase recycling of local waste by 70 per cent – all by 2050. Over the past five years there has been a decrease in the overall resource recovery rate in the city from 32 per cent in 2015-16 to 23 per cent in 2019-20. In 2018, the council banned glass being disposed in yellow-tip bins to reduce high contamination rates of paper and cardboard to meet the requirements of a recycling contract. A recent survey conducted by the council found 90 per cent of respondents wanted to see it returned. Glass collection points in Brassall, Churchill, Riverview and Rosewood in place over the past three years will remain. The more than 300 tonnes of glass collected at these facilities only accounted for about nine per cent of all glass collected by the city since 2018. Cr Harding said the glass, which was being sent to landfill, will now go to the council's recycling contractors in Brisbane to be used to make new glass bottles and jars and sand substitutes in roads and drainage. “We found (contamination is) not really an issue,” she said. “Our Resource Recovery Strategy clearly outlined a lot of figures to show that wasn't an issue for us. “As far as I know it's been going to landfill.” The city's main tip in Riverview is more than 30-years-old and had about 170,000 visitors last year, up from 142,000 in 2018. It is “experiencing significant capacity constraints” according to council officers as it has not had a capacity upgrade since it was built. The Rosewood tip is more than 25-years old. The council intends to build a brand new recycling and refuse centre by 2025 The State Government's waste levy, introduced in 2019, is $85 per tonne for general household waste but offset by a rebate paid by the government to the council to protect ratepayers. Cr Harding said the rebate payments to the council were set to end next year and this cost would be passed on to ratepayers. “We do receive 42 per cent of the waste that's collected in Queensland,” she said. “We're working really hard to be smart and take advantage of the economic opportunities that provides while still maintaining the liveability for people. “I think (the waste levy ending) is really disappointing for the people of Ipswich. “It will mean an extra $80 to $90 added to their rates bill. When it was introduced the state government did say that no households would be impacted by this. “We'll be continuing, as well as the other councils in Queensland, to lobby the State Government to extend that. “It's unfair that the residents of Ipswich … are forced to pay this.” Read more stories by Lachlan McIvor here Originally published as Glass returned to recycling bins in Ipswich after being sent to landfill for three years",N,,,

Sub-par building codes and standards can have a “devastating impact on housing affordability,” he says, and reforms to construction codes, more insurer guidance around retrofitting and better communication of natural hazard risk information need to remain “top of mind when making any further recommendations about the availability of land and the impact of housing”.



Noting insurers are facing a shortage of tradespeople to complete repairs due to the closure of borders during COVID, the ICA cautioned that any uplift in activity on the supply side “must be undertaken and assessed with robust planning arrangements and stronger building certification requirements in place if we are to positively impact housing affordability in the long run”.

Robust planning controls are key to making housing more accessible, Mr Hall said in an opening statement to the parliamentary inquiry into housing affordability and supply in Australia, and consideration of natural hazards should be central to supply-side policy discussions.

“The pressures on release of land to enable ongoing development too often supersedes the adequate and necessary review of whether it is safe to put homes there at all,” Mr Hall said.

“The evidence of the impacts of poor planning decisions have been seen across decades of summer bushfire or flooding disasters.

“The National Construction Code should be amended to ensure greater resilience for homes, and have stronger durability against extreme weather incorporated into building design and construction requirements,” he said.

Sub-par building codes and standards can have a “devastating impact on housing affordability,” he says, and reforms to construction codes, more insurer guidance around retrofitting and better communication of natural hazard risk information need to remain “top of mind when making any further recommendations about the availability of land and the impact of housing”.

Current building in Australia occurs to a minimum standard mandated to ensure life preservation but “not constructed with property preservation as a core consideration,” Mr Hall says, noting estimates $6.2 billion is needed to address building defects and safety issues in Australia.

Immediate action on a nationally consistent basis is needed to address the required building reforms, he says.

Noting insurers are facing a shortage of tradespeople to complete repairs due to the closure of borders during COVID, the ICA cautioned that any uplift in activity on the supply side “must be undertaken and assessed with robust planning arrangements and stronger building certification requirements in place if we are to positively impact housing affordability in the long run”.

Mr Hall also says levies imposed on insurance are retrograde revenue measures that numerous inquiries have found lead to household underinsurance or non-insurance. Total government taxes and duties on homeowners ranged up to 40% on top of the cost of the premium.

General insurers provide Australians 43 million policies each year and pay more than $166 million in claims every day.

“These conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern and to be able to pay its debts as and when they fall due,” the company's financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020 said.

The owner accused developer Australia YMCI of using its majority status on the building's strata committee to vote down motions to repair fire safety doors.

NSW Building Commissioner David Chandler slapped a fix it order on the project in March, saying the property has waterproofing issues on the balconies and dodgy tiling work that each amounted to a “serious defect”.

The troubles facing Australia YMCI couldn't come at a worse time for owners living in the Ovation Quarter apartments in Lidcombe, near Sydney Olympic Park. One apartment owner told The Saturday Telegraph this week one of the buildings has chronic waterproofing, fire safety and security problems that remain unresolved. Documents lodged with regulator ASIC in July reveal the company had an $83m deficit this year compared to a 2019 deficit of $32m. “These conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern and to be able to pay its debts as and when they fall due,” the company's financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020 said. “Therefore the company may be unable to realise its assets and extinguish its liabilities in the normal course of business and at the amounts stated in the financial statements.” The $5 billion development is over 18ha and includes 14-storey apartment towers, retail areas and a future school. The first stage was approved in 2019 and includes 451 apartments. One owner said major waterproofing and fire safety issues have not been rectified since they were first raised in January. “There have been delays after delays fixing these problems and they always blame Covid instead of getting it sorted out,” the owner, who did not want to be named, said. “A brand-new building simply should not be leaking like that. “Residents are also concerned about fire safety and security because the fire doors remain faulty.” The owner accused developer Australia YMCI of using its majority status on the building's strata committee to vote down motions to repair fire safety doors. NSW Building Commissioner David Chandler slapped a fix it order on the project in March, saying the property has waterproofing issues on the balconies and dodgy tiling work that each amounted to a “serious defect”. The company is challenging the building work rectification order in the NSW Land and Environment Court. The maximum penalty for noncompliance with a building work rectification order is $330,000 plus $33,000 per day for each day the offence continues. The private certifier for the property was Steven Saad. In 2018 Mr Saad was fined $15,000 by NSW Fair Trading after he issued construction certificates for a change of building use “which did not comply with BCA fire safety requirements”. He was also the private certifier on a 25-apartment complex at Mascot that in January was found by the Building Commissioner to have serious fire safety issues.

Brickworks' managing director Lindsay Partridge agrees timber and steel shortages, rather than brick supply, is restricting the building sector.

Labour of love State borders and lockdowns aside, the national border closure is creating a labour shortage in construction, which, Partridge says, will have flow-on effects to housing demand.

The head of advocacy and policy at the Recruitment, Consulting and Staffing Association Australia and New Zealand, Brooke Lord, says while lockdowns have created a labour shortage in construction, long-term, systemic problems are a contributing factor.

In fact, the sector is facing a dearth of labourers of all types—and the issue will only be exacerbated by the two-week halt to construction in Victoria announced last week. Housing Industry Association chief economist Tim Reardon says there have been periodic building material shortages this year, with timber rather than bricks the big issue. “That's taken time to resolve and hopefully we'll see an easing of timber shortages towards the end of this year,” he says. “But bricks are made almost exclusively in Australia. We do import some bricks from overseas, which tend to be high-end, artistic-style products, and shortages are fairly common, even in a normal year. “Constraints on international shipping are causing disruptions to trade, impacting all imported building products. “So any perceived shortage of bricks reflects more the impact of lockdowns on freight and trade, rather than a structural problem with supply of bricks. “The construction sector is booming, but when I say that to brick suppliers they ask, ‘when's it coming? We've increased our capacity and we're making bricks in anticipation of rising demand, but we can't see this in our operations'. So there's ample capacity. “From that point onwards, the boom in home construction will slow. By the end of 2022, the number of homes under construction will be back to normal.” Brett Lavaring from The MJH Group, which operates brands across Australia including McDonald Jones Homes, Mojo Homes, Brighton Homes, Weeks Homes and Wilson Homes, confirms there is ample supply of bricks but “we are seeing some challenges securing a labour force to lay bricks across Queensland, NSW, South Australia and Tasmania.” ▲ Bricks are stockpiling and manufacturers are slowing production as supply outpaces demand. Reardon attributes the boom to a number of factors, including the federal government's HomeBuilder grant, which has ended but projects from it are still working their way through the construction sector; as well as low interest rates. He expects buoyant conditions to continue. “The pandemic is prompting households to make two decisions,” Reardon says. “They are seeking lower-density housing so they have more living areas, more space to work from home, additional bedrooms for kids to study at home and larger back yards. There is a shift from high-density housing towards lower-density living. “They are also saving like they never have before. So there's a large amount of pent-up demand for expenditure and when the economy opens, people will continue to invest in either renovations or new home construction.” Brickworks' managing director Lindsay Partridge agrees timber and steel shortages, rather than brick supply, is restricting the building sector. The business recently announced record underlying net profit after tax of $285 million, up a stunning 95 per cent on the previous year. “Lockdowns in NSW and Victoria mean you're not getting the full number of trades onto site because workers cannot move from state to state, so that's slowed things down. “This is a real problem in Western Australia where the number of new houses being built has doubled in the past year, and to some extent in South Australia.” Partridge says he was selling a million bricks a day to customers in NSW before the lockdown began on July 21. “Suddenly, we were only selling 200,000 bricks a day, so we were stockpiling 800,000 bricks a day. “We could only do that for three weeks because our yards were full, so we had to take plants offline. “We're now supplying about 85 per cent of our usual daily sales and we've been able to bring some of that plant back online. So it's a constant balancing act.” Labour of love State borders and lockdowns aside, the national border closure is creating a labour shortage in construction, which, Partridge says, will have flow-on effects to housing demand. “There are no skilled workers coming into the country, which eventually will mean we won't need to build as many houses.” Recent building approval figures show this effect has already started. The total number of dwelling approvals fell 8.6 per cent in July, while the number of approvals for private sector houses fell by 5.8 per cent. “While the speed at which new homes are being built peaked in April, there are more homes currently under construction than we've ever had before, by a large margin,” Reardon says. ▲ New dwelling approvals declined for a fourth consecutive month as the surge in detached housing, propelled by the HomeBuilder stimulus, continues to drop out of the system. “And that's going to continue until the end of this year. At that point, the number of homes that are reaching completion will be higher than the number of homes that are commencing construction.” The head of advocacy and policy at the Recruitment, Consulting and Staffing Association Australia and New Zealand, Brooke Lord, says while lockdowns have created a labour shortage in construction, long-term, systemic problems are a contributing factor. “Apprenticeship numbers have dwindled during the past six years, which is putting enormous pressure on talent in the construction sector.” There were 266,565 apprentices and trainees completing their training in Australia as at June 30, down 3.9 per cent on June 2019 figures, according to the National Centre for Vocational Education Research. Lord says enhanced Centrelink payments are another factor. While JobSeeker has ended, when it was available some people on lower salaries made a choice to accept payments through enhanced social welfare mechanisms rather than work. No new normal While NSW and Victoria have mapped out some steps for re-opening post-lockdown, it's not yet clear when construction activity will return to a more normal footing. Partridge isn't expecting the economy to snap back when lockdowns end. “We're going to have rolling shutdowns and lockdowns for the next six months. Supply constraints of imported materials will also continue because shipping is in chaos. It will take us six to 12 months to emerge from this and pent-up demand is going to take a year or two to work through.” Lord says labour shortages will continue to be challenging for the next two years. “The labour market is under enormous stress. This won't change until border restrictions ease, the national border opens and the flow of workers, holiday visa makers and overseas students come back.” It may be a long two years for the construction sector.

Following the CMA investigation, Countryside Properties has voluntarily given formal commitments to the watchdog to remove terms from its leasehold contracts that cause ground rents to double.

The insurance group Aviva, which bought freeholds from developers, agreed in June to remove ground rent terms that were considered unfair and repay homeowners whose rents doubled after the CMA's investigation.

The CMA wrote to Countryside and Taylor Wimpey in March , asking them to remove the ground rent terms from their contracts.

The contractual cost increases can leave some house owners struggling to sell or mortgage their homes while their rights to their property can also be at risk if they fall behind on ground rent payments. Following the CMA investigation, Countryside Properties has voluntarily given formal commitments to the watchdog to remove terms from its leasehold contracts that cause ground rents to double. The company will also remove terms from updated contracts that meant the ground rent increased in line with the higher retail prices index measure of inflation. Affected leaseholders' ground rent will now remain at the amount charged when they bought their home and will not increase over time. Countryside confirmed that it no longer sells leasehold properties with doubling ground rent clauses. The announcement comes a year after the CMA launched enforcement action against four housing developers – Countryside, Taylor Wimpey, Barratt Developments and Persimmon Homes – which it believes may have broken consumer protection law in relation to leasehold homes. The insurance group Aviva, which bought freeholds from developers, agreed in June to remove ground rent terms that were considered unfair and repay homeowners whose rents doubled after the CMA's investigation. The housebuilder Persimmon also agreed at the time to offer leasehold homeowners the opportunity to buy the freehold of their property at a discounted price, and to make repayments to some homeowners who bought their freeholds.

Andrea Coscelli, the CMA's chief executive, said: “Leaseholders with Countryside can now breathe a sigh of relief knowing they will no longer be forced to pay these doubling ground rents. No one should feel like a prisoner in their home, trapped by terms that mean they can struggle to sell or mortgage their property.” Coscelli called on Taylor Wimpey and other developers to “do the right thing by their leaseholders and remove these problematic clauses from their contracts”. He added: “If they refuse, we stand ready to step in and take further action – through the courts if necessary.” Countryside said it had not sold any properties with doubling ground rent clauses since 2017. It added that it expected to put aside a further £5m to cover the ground rent assistance scheme, taking its total provision for the scheme to £15m. Iain McPherson, Countryside's chief executive, said: “Countryside has engaged extensively and constructively with the CMA throughout the course of its review to reach this positive outcome for affected leaseholders.” As part of its review of the leasehold sector, the CMA said it was continuing its investigation into Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey. In addition, the watchdog is looking into investment groups Brigante Properties, Abacus Land and Adriatic Land. Earlier in the year, it wrote to the firms about its concerns, and requested they remove doubling ground rent terms from their contracts. Mike Amesbury, the shadow housing minister, welcomed the CMA's announcement, but called on the government to tackle what he called the “leasehold scandal”, on in which “ever more innocent homeowners are being trapped in feudal leasehold homes, facing extortionate fees, poor service and restrictive contract terms without recourse”. “We cannot wait for the CMA to investigate every abuse of leasehold. The government must finally bring forward leasehold reform, which has been promised for years,” Amesbury said.

Structural issues as well as supply contribute to Australian property prices.Credit:Bloomberg
Industry groups, politicians, and others ignore these differences and refuse to consider structural solutions to Australia’s housing problems.

Industry groups, politicians, and others ignore these differences and refuse to consider structural solutions to Australia’s housing problems. It’s easier to blame planning regulation and a lack of new supply.

But it takes heroic conviction to argue a lack of supply is our housing problem when Australia’s population growth has made a reverse turn. Over the past two years net overseas migration has fallen into negative territory, yet house prices, propelled by low interest rates and government grants, have continued their stratospheric rise. Between March 2020-2021, Australia’s population growth fell from 1.5 per cent to a mere 0.1 per cent, due to a net overseas migration loss of 95,300 people. Yet by June 2021, house prices had risen by almost 17 per cent.
Would “reforming” state and local planning systems arrest this price growth? Supply “splainers” argue that new construction is the only way to cool prices, and that planning rules are the only constraint on construction. They point to zoning, height and density controls as examples of this constraint. Often, they draw on studies from the United States or the United Kingdom (where planning systems are very different and local governments are more powerful) as “evidence” of the impact of planning on Australia’s housing markets.
The problem is that none of these commentators refer to actual data on the ways in which Australian planning systems operate, or how land developers and property owners behave. In Australia, where the states and territories have consistently overruled local concerns about new and higher density developments, record numbers of new homes have been delivered over the past five years. In Greater Sydney, housing completions have more than doubled over the past decade, rising from less than 15,000 per year in 2010-2011 to nearly 43,000 by 2018-19; almost 30,000 of which were multi-unit developments.

NSW has the most expensive real estate in Australia, taking out the top five spots of the top 10, with three in metropolitan Sydney. Half of the national top 10 areas for annual growth were in the regions, with Coffs Harbour on the NSW mid-north coast and Queensland's Sunshine Coast both experiencing annual price increases of 30.2 per cent. CoreLogic research director Tim Lawless said the areas with surging property prices had something in common. 'The strongest housing markets do show some common themes, with coastal and lifestyle markets featuring predominantly across the list,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Michael Yardney, chief executive of buyers' agent Metropole, said richer postcodes and gentrifying areas in Sydney, Melbourne, or Brisbane were the best long-term bet beyond the boom. 'These are the suburbs where many affluent millennials are aspiring to move as they enter the family formation stage of their lives,' he said. 'When this wealthier demographic moves into a suburb and this translates to being an area where locals are able to and prepared to pay a premium price to live there, putting a financial floor under your investment property.' But he urged investors to avoid poorer, outer suburbs on the basis borrowers in these postcodes were more likely to be in mortgage stress. 'I would avoid investing in the more affordable locations,' he said. 'This end of the property market underperforms over the long term, with regards to capital growth and rental growth, because many of the owners are young families who have stretched themselves to their financial limits and are often only a week or two weeks away from broke. 'Covid-19 has adversely affected low-income earners to a greater extent than middle and high-income earners who are likely to recover their income back to pre-pandemic levels more quickly, while many have not been hit at all.' The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority considers a borrower to be in mortgage stress, where they can't meet their monthly repayments, if they have a debt-to-income ratio of six or more. Australia's median property price stood at $674,848 in September, which means someone on an average, full-time salary of $90,329 would be in mortgage stress paying off such a property even with a 20 per cent deposit factored in. The banking regulator is now requiring lenders to model how a borrower would handle a 3 percentage point increase to their mortgage rate. Someone borrowing $540,000 with a 20 per cent deposit to buy a typical Australian home, priced at $675,000, would owe the bank an extra $914 a month should rates rise to five per cent from the present low levels near 2 per cent. This would see their monthly repayment climb from $2,048 to $2,962. Sydney's median property price, taking in houses and units, climbed by 23.6 per cent in the year to September to $1.056 million. But Newcastle and Lake Macquarie, a two-hour drive away, had an even bigger annual increase of 28.1 per cent, taking median home values to $771,017. Geelong, southwest of Melbourne, saw its real estate prices increase by 24.6 per cent to $745,122. Propertyology head of research Simon Pressley said regional areas were a better long-term prospect than Sydney or Melbourne. Before the pandemic saw immigration turned off, they each saw 100,000 new residents. The lockdowns convinced many residents to leave for regional areas, with the population outside capital cities increasing by 51,000 in the year to March 2021 as Melbourne's population fell by 50,000, and Sydney lost 6,000 residents. 'To put the size of Sydney and Melbourne's population decline into perspective, the volume of people is big enough to create an entire city the size of Mildura - Australia's 40th biggest city - Noosa, Dubbo or Albury,' Mr Pressely said. 'It's astonishing.' Within the big cities, Mr Yardney said high-rise apartments should be avoided, with quality problems for complexes in Sydney Olympic Park and Mascot near Sydney Airport. 'High-rise apartment towers in our CBDs, which were already suffering from the adverse publicity of structural problems prior to Covid-19, will now become the slums of the future as they are shunned by homeowners and investors,' he said. Home prices in September hit record highs in three-quarters of Australia's real estate sub-markets, based on a collection of suburbs. But the boom is not evenly spread with national apartment values climbing by 12 per cent over the year, compared with 22.9 per cent for houses. Unit values in Sydney grew at a slower-than-average pace of 11.6 per cent with larger apartments doing better than smaller, one-bedroom offerings. In Melbourne, apartment values increased by 8.3 per cent compared with Brisbane's 8.8 per cent and just 5.7 per cent in Adelaide. The story was dramatically different in Hobart where apartment prices in one year surged by 31.1 per cent to $542,464 as the mid-point price of Perth units climbed by 15 per cent to a still-affordable $398,502.

The Australian Institute of Building Surveyors (AIBS), which represents private construction inspectors, says there are up to 20,000 orphaned building permits across Victoria.
The term refers to permits that cannot be completed because a project's building surveyor is no longer in business and no other surveyors are willing to take on the job due to crippling insurance liabilities.
Wayne Liddy from the AIBS said the phenomenon was a growing problem that was leaving thousands of consumers in the lurch and unable to live in their homes for months or even years at a time.
He said the institute had been warning authorities about orphaned building permits for more than a decade and called on the Victorian government to intervene.

The stand-off over building permits has left Deborah Child trapped in a nightmare for the past four months.
In June, the retired teacher and her family were kicked out of the house they had built at Mt Eliza, on Melbourne's south-eastern fringe.
Ms Child said the catalyst for the eviction was an objection they lodged with the council over a neighbour's building proposal.
She said that in dealing with the complaint, the council discovered they had failed to get a certificate of occupancy before moving into the house in 2015.
After being forced out, she said matters became infinitely more difficult when she in turn discovered that the building surveyor originally engaged for the project had been deregistered.
Since then, the 61-year-old said she had been turned away by almost two dozen surveyors who said they were unable to complete the task.
""It's been horrendous,"" Ms Child said.
""Naively, we thought that it was a matter of just getting someone to help finalise all other paperwork because the house was finished.
""It's habitable — it's a beautiful home, and so that's what we thought we were facing.
""Then what we've ended up encountering is this incredibly complex situation that we actually don't know how we're going to solve.
""We desperately want to get back to our house, but we've got no way of solving the problem and, bizarrely, nobody is open to helping.""
 Concerns over high-rise cladding have sent insurance costs rocketing for building surveyors.(ABC News: Patrick Rocca)Insurance crisis behind problem
Mr Liddy said a crisis in the professional indemnity insurance market for building surveyors was driving much of the problem.
He said a clampdown by the government on surveyors over the flammable cladding scandal had sent insurance premiums through the roof, threatening the viability of many providers.
Mr Liddy said while the problem was not unique to Victoria – there were related issues at play in New South Wales and Tasmania – it was most prevalent in that state.
""It's purely risk, and many of the underwriters of the professional indemnity and indemnity policies will advise not to take on that risk,"" he said.
Under Victorian law, the Victorian Building Authority (VBA) can step in and appoint a manager in the event a building surveyor dies, is imprisoned, or has their licence suspended or cancelled.
But Mr Liddy said the government had so far been unwilling to use the powers.
 Richard Wynne says councils have the power to help affected consumers.(ABC News: Jeremy Story Carter)Go to council for aid: Minister
Victorian Planning Minister Richard Wynne declined to be drawn on whether the laws had ever been invoked.
He said the government was aware of the problem, but suggested affected homeowners approach local authorities.
""Homeowners let down by a private building surveyor can go to their local council for help,"" Mr Wynne said.
""Municipal building surveyors can issue occupancy certificates and homeowners should seek a remedy from their local government authority.""
'Circular' arguments fail consumers
Natasha Stojanovich, a partner at Lander  Rogers specialising in construction insurance law, said the prevalence of orphaned permits pointed to regulatory and market failures in the building industry.
 Insurance lawyer Natasha Stojanovich says the government should find a way to address the problem.(Supplied: Lander  Rogers)Ms Stojanovich said it was disingenuous to argue councils should take on unfinished building permits given their insurance risks would be similarly cost prohibitive.
She suggested the government had a responsibility to intervene, either by directly helping stranded homeowners or by backing a workable indemnity insurance scheme for surveyors.
""Under the legislation, yes, a municipal building surveyor can take it on, or the VBA can do certain things,"" Ms Stojanovich said.
""But both the VBA and the councils are concerned about the liability risks as well and are not wanting to take on these poisoned chalice projects, so they're not interested either.
""It's just becoming a bit circular where councils are saying the VBA should sort it out, the VBA is saying councils should sort it out.",N insurance case,,,

They would also need to set themselves targets to improve how well-insulated the homes on their books were. This means properties that didn't meet these standards could become tricky or even impossible for homeowners to remortgage on or sell. The issues could mirror those faced by owners of flats with dangerous cladding that have become impossible to get rid of. The Government plans were published in the Net Zero Strategy which outlines Boris Johnson's plans to meet climate targets such as reaching net zero carbon by 2050. They are also part of an ongoing government consultation. If implemented they could mean that homeowners face having to make costly energy efficiency improvements if they want to sell their properties. The cost of installing an eco-friendly ground source heat pump for example can be more than £20,000. Energy efficiency is measured by EPC ratings which rank properties from A, the most efficient, to G, the least. Those in older homes and period properties find it harder to make their homes greener. Almost 1.7 million homes in England and Wales with an EPC rating between D and G cannot be improved to reach a C rating, according to Rightmove. Critics warned the plan could hit first-time buyers and families with period properties. Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said some homeowners would find it ‘prohibitively expensive' to make their house more energy efficient. ‘They may not be able to afford to borrow more, or the cost of changes to older properties may be disproportionately high, so they'd never recoup the cost of the improvements through a sale,' she said. Ms Coles said it is ‘likely to get much harder to track down a cheap mortgage for an inefficient property, which will make them more difficult to sell, which in turn is likely to bring down their value'. She added: ‘Owners may also struggle to re-mortgage, so could end up paying over the odds each month... ‘If you're living in an old family home, and you need to trade down to boost your income in retirement, it could have far-reaching consequences for the rest of your life.' Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, a former energy minister, condemned the plans as ‘an insult to first-time buyers who have scraped and saved to get on the housing ladder'. ‘The Conservatives must cancel this plan immediately,' he said. ‘Ministers are attempting to clean up their own mess by forcing innocent first-time buyers to fork out thousands of pounds extra, just as an interest rate rise is about to bite.' But trade association UK Finance said banks and other lenders are committed to making sure customers are not left behind. A spokesman said: ‘Greening our housing stock is vital if we are to meet our climate change obligations and banks and finance providers are committed to helping achieve this goal and making sure consumers are not left behind.' The new Heat and Buildings Strategy states that the Government ‘consulted on proposals to require mortgage lenders to disclose information regarding the EPC rating of their lending portfolios'. ‘We also proposed a voluntary target to reach an average of EPC band C across their mortgage portfolio by 2030, with the option of making this target mandatory if insufficient progress is being made,' it says. Downing Street said it was considering the responses to the consultation and ‘would only introduce a policy which was guided by fairness for the public'. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ‘We have consulted on setting requirements for mortgage lenders to support homeowners to improve the energy performance of their homes. ‘The aim of that is to catalyse the development of a green finance market and make available affordable finance.'

But not ex-advertising man Geoff - he's decided to spend his golden years building a pedestal palace right on a flood plain with a £700,000 budget and ambitious eight month schedule. In tonight's episode of the Channel 4 show, Geoff, who grew up in the East End of London , explains that he is selling his luxury villa in Spain , where he has been for 20 years, to take on one of the biggest challenges of his life - a flood resistant architectural marvel on the Essex coast. Unlike his daughter, Geoff sees no risk in sinking every penny he has into this unusual building and moves into a small caravan on site. 'I'm at the stage in my life now where I don't know how long I've got left, so what I've got left, I want to enjoy,' says Geoff, whose early retirement was soon followed by the breakup of his 32-year marriage. 'I'm 63 but I still feel like I was when I was 23. I don't feel that I'm old.' The plot of watery wilderness is an empty canvas on which Geoff plans to paint a new life and is an impressive 7 and a half acres big - but it doesn't come without its problems. 'A large site it may be, but it is a flood plain so the planners have insisted any house here would need to be flood-resistant,' explains presenter Kevin McCloud. Geoff - who wants to get involved with the construction despite no previous experience - predicts the build, which is a resilient, radical heavy-duty response to the ever-changing threat of our climate - will be approximately 15ft or so above the ground. As Kevin McCloud explains: 'Geoff didn't have a say in designing this gravity-defying building. He actually bought the land with planning for £325,000.' He adds that the original architects who have a lot of experience with flood-proof houses won't be involved and that Geoff isn't even using a professional project manager - because he plans on doing that job himself. Noting how this is a really complex house to build, Kevin continues: 'Arguably, the most important part of Geoff's solo project will be underground. Here, 30 heavy weight, concrete steel piles will be drilled 14 metres deep. 'These piles will be key in anchoring this house to the ground. Some will have to resist upward forces of over 200 tonne. The piles will connect to an industrial steel-strength frame, comprising 560 steel girders - forming one huge cantilever. The frame's job is to transform the load of the building into the earth.' He continues: 'The ground floor will be poured in waterproof concrete and will house a utility area and a garage. 'Upstairs, the external and the partition walls will all be made from timber - wrapping between and around the steels. On this floor, an open plan living room and kitchen will lead to a large balcony through floor to ceiling windows, with views that will stretch out across the estuary.' Kevin goes on to say that the three bedrooms will each have a slice of these views and have their own en-suite bathrooms, while an eye-catching, jagged roof finished with solared tiles will help to power the highly unusual island home. He adds: 'Should the local flood defences be breeched, a bunged wall will keep Geoff's garden dry, but if the waters rise further, his power supply and drainage will be protected and the living spaces will continue to function.' Geoff - who explains that he's already sold his property in London to buy the land - says that he's got enough money to start the project but to finish it, he'll have to sell his villa in Spain, which is already on the market. Having sold his UK home, he has to find somewhere to live for the duration of the build - a caravan. This is his base through wind and the rain as he project manages the complicated construction of a house designed to be safe in a one in a thousand year flood event. But ten months on since he started, after £190,000 worth of anchoring steel and concrete foundations are drilled over fourteen metres into the ground, Geoff hits double trouble – not just Covid but a collapse in the Spanish property market, meaning he's struggling to sell his villa. Without funds to continue and trapped in his cold caravan, the odds are stacked against him - and Geoff is delayed for another agonising five months. 'This could be one of the last building days for a long time yet until I get some more money,' he admits. 'Everyone thinks I'm making a mistake - my bank manager thinks I'm making a mistake, an awful lot of people I know think I'm making a mistake. But, the more people who think I'm making a mistake, the more I think I'm doing it right because I've been told that my whole life.' Refusing to give up, there is one expression this East End boxer knows well – ‘No guts, No glory'! But soon, Geoff encounters another issue when the building team realise they've been working off the wrong plans, which they claim they 'hadn't been made aware of.' As a result, some of the columns the team installed weren't lining up where they thought they'd be - adding a further six weeks onto the project length. While the steel team swallow the extra costs, Kevin McCloud notes that you could argue it was the project manager's responsibility. 'I can't ever be at fault - I'm the project manager,' says Geoff. 'I'm never at fault!'",N personal experience,,,

Key points: Calls for a crackdown on dodgy builders in Tasmania are growing, with homeowners speaking out about traumatic experiences The state's building regulator insists there are enough consumer protections, but the Opposition is pushing for a parliamentary inquiry A group of homeowners affected by building defects have met with the Minister for Consumer Affairs, who has committed to looking at improvements Nearly two years on it's still not finished and they've spent an extra $150,000 fixing defects and $50,000 on legal fees. The couple, who are approaching retirement, describe it as the most traumatic experience of their life. ""It's been really tough, my wife lost 10 kilos, I don't know how much I lost but she lost 10 kilos of weight, regularly in tears, the stress levels were unbelievable,"" Adriane Creamer said. Issues with their build surfaced four months in when Mr Creamer said he realised his cladding had been installed incorrectly. Then other tradesmen — the tiler and kitchen joiner — started raising concerns with the couple about new walls being not completely vertical and the floor not being level. ""The kitchen there was 30 millimetres lower on one side of the room than it is on the other side of the room, there were issues with the deck, it wasn't fixed to the main building properly,"" Mr Creamer said. Adriane and Gillian Creamer are still counting the cost of their failed renovation. ABC News: Maren Preuss When he questioned the builder about the issues, the couple said the relationship became so strained, they sought legal advice and an assessment from a second building surveyor. ""We had a building surveyor who was heartily recommended by our builder, but the problem with that was, he basically didn't see anything [wrong],"" Mr Creamer said. The second surveyor's report listed a number of problems. ""He [the builder] got about 30 things wrong with the build, 30 defects, 12 of which were so serious we couldn't live in the house or sell the house until they were satisfactorily repaired,"" Mr Creamer said. Mr Creamer has spent thousands of dollars he didn't expect to spend on his renovation. ABC News: Maren Preuss The relevant regulator in Tasmania, the Consumer, Building and Occupation Services (CBOS), insists there are sufficient consumer protections to force builders to fix defects, without resorting to legal action. In a statement, a spokesman said during construction, the building surveyor can issue direction notices to require rectification of defects. ""If a builder fails to comply, the permit authority of the relevant council has powers to enforce compliance,"" the spokesman said. If defects are discovered after practical completion, CBOS said it had a range of dispute resolution processes, including adjudication. ""And an adjudication outcome made by a panel, has the effect of an order of the Magistrates Court,"" the spokesman said. The Creamers, who were desperate to move into their home, were worried this process could drag on for many months, if not years, and did not trust their builder to properly repair the work. Acting on the advice of their experienced property lawyer, they terminated their building contract and have paid other tradesmen to repair the defects. Parliamentary inquiry needed, Labor MP says Labor MP Jen Butler said she is regularly contacted about dodgy builders and Tasmanians were being left hundreds of thousands of dollars out of pocket. ""We think it's time for us as a parliament to have a look to the future of the industry in Tasmania and how we can better protect consumers and how we can better protect our building industry,"" Ms Butler said. Ms Butler says over 20,000 people are now working in construction in Tasmania, and they too are frustrated. ABC News: Maren Preuss She will table a motion in Parliament on Thursday for a select committee inquiry on consumer and building sector protections in the Tasmanian building and construction industry. ""Consumers are repeatedly facing issues with problem builders with very little recourse except taking really expensive legal action and a lot of the time the consumers have already invested just about everything that they've got into the build,"" Ms Butler said. ""A lot of the time the legal action isn't in their favour and it takes an awful long time for it to be resolved,"" she said. She said the proposed inquiry would examine the adequacy of current legislative and regulatory mechanisms available to CBOS to investigate and compel builders to fix defective work. ""Tasmania's building and construction industry is booming … from time to time there are shonky builders and we want to see how we best protect the quality reputation that Tasmanian builders have,"" Ms Butler said. ""So many builders are really frustrated, because when you have shonky building practices it undermines the reputation of the whole industry."" The Creamers are backing calls for a parliamentary inquiry but in the meantime have taken matters into their own hands. They have erected signs on their front lawn to raise awareness about their experience and are urging people to know their rights. ""We're going to try to do what we can to change what needs to be changed in Tasmania to make it a level playing field."" Home owners disappointed with Minister The Minister for Consumer Affairs, Elise Archer, has already rejected the idea of a parliamentary inquiry, even before the terms of reference have been tabled in Parliament. She said she understood the concerns raised by several individuals interviewed by the ABC last month and she met with them recently to discuss a way forward. Mr Creamer has begun warning others about his situation, in the hope it won't happen to anyone else. ABC News: Maren Preuss She said many of their issues related to legislation that had since been strengthened. ""While many of the issues raised relate to circumstances before our amendments, I have asked my department to look at any potential improvements that could be made to further strengthen the framework moving forward,"" Ms Archer said. ""Therefore, there is no need for a parliamentary inquiry,"" she said. Ms Archer says work is underway to make the disputes process less convoluted. ABC News: Luke Bowden She said a new tribunal would commence in November called the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (TasCAT). ""I am already considering whether TasCAT could handle disputes around these issues into the future to make it simpler, faster and cheaper to resolve such disputes,"" Ms Archer said. It has angered some consumers, like Launceston homeowner Ash Dunn, who said it appeared the meeting with Elise Archer and CBOS a few weeks ago had been a waste of time. ""We need an inquiry for the sake of transparency and to get to the bottom of things.""",N renovation,,,

Gove has met Conservative rebels who have attacked the government's plans as inadequate – particularly for those in shorter blocks not covered by the £5bn building safety fund, which only covers combustible cladding.

At least 30 Tory MPs including McPartland, Iain Duncan Smith and Peter Bottomley are expected to rebel against the building safety bill due to go through parliament this autumn, by proposing amendments to protect leaseholders from costs.

Meanwhile, leaseholders who live in shorter blocks with dangerous cladding are still facing huge costs and unsellable homes, as well as bearing costs for other fire safety measures.

The cross-party housing select committee has called for the proposed loans scheme to be scrapped in favour of a fund, jointly paid for by the government and industry, that would meet the full costs without leaseholders being forced to contribute.","['building', 'costs', 'insurance', 'safety', 'crisis', 'Gove', 'building safety', 'government', 'buildings', 'blocks', 'leaseholders', 'secretary', 'cladding', 'remediation', 'Adriatic', 'aluminium composite', 'Conservative', 'Boris Johnson', 'fire safety', 'Travelodge', 'holistic', 'City Gate', 'Manchester', 'hotel', 'bear', 'survey', 'housing secretary', 'Scandal', 'department', 'Lucy Powell', 'ACM', 'mortgage', 'mortgages', 'MP', 'bill', 'inadequate', 'insurance premium', 'Stevenage', 'Peter Bottomley', 'Grenfell Tower fire', 'Guernsey', 'select committee', 'Iain Duncan Smith', 'Labour', 'high-rise', 'Tory', 'investment fund']","[{'confident': True, 'id': 'IAB11-3', 'label': 'U.S. Government Resources', 'level': 2, 'score': 0.4, 'taxonomy': 'iab-qag', 'links': {'parent': 'https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB11', 'self': 'https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB11-3'}}, {'confident': True, 'id': 'IAB13-6', 'label': 'Insurance', 'level': 2, 'score': 0.2, 'taxonomy': 'iab-qag', 'links': {'parent': 'https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB13', 'self': 'https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB13-6'}}, {'confident': True, 'id': 'IAB13', 'label': 'Personal Finance', 'level': 1, 'score': 0.16, 'taxonomy': 'iab-qag', 'links': {'self': 'https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB13'}}, {'confident': True, 'id': 'IAB11', 'label': 'Law, Gov’t & Politics', 'level': 1, 'score': 0.15, 'taxonomy': 'iab-qag', 'links': {'self': 'https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB11'}}, {'confident': False, 'id': '04004000', 'label': 'construction and property', 'level': 2, 'score': 0.09, 'taxonomy': 'iptc-subjectcode', 'links': {'parent': 'https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iptc-subjectcode/04000000', 'self': 'https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iptc-subjectcode/04004000'}}]",[247663249],"to pay for repairs, in the first signs of a new government push to tackle the widening scandal. Boris Johnson has tasked his new secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities with resolving the post-Grenfell crisis that has left hundreds of thousands of leaseholders in affected flats facing bills for tens of thousands of pounds. Gove is examining whether the government could underwrite home insurance for residents whose properties are deemed at risk until remediation work is carried out. A recent survey of 143 blocks by the Association of Residential Managing Agents found gross premiums had soared from £8m to £29m in a year. More than four years after the Grenfell Tower fire, nearly 200 high-rise apartment blocks with similar aluminium composite cladding have not been fully fixed. When buildings with other types of combustible cladding and other fire safety faults are counted, campaigners estimated more than 1 million leaseholders could be affected. It is understood Gove has also asked for advice from civil servants about why it has proved so difficult to seek legal redress against companies that will not fix potentially unsafe buildings. One alternative under consideration is naming and shaming the firms responsible – or even hauling them into the department, as Gove did with water company bosses over leaks when he was environment secretary. “If we can't go after people legally, are there other ways to put pressure on them?” said a government source, adding: “This is a new secretary of state who is looking afresh at everything.” Ministers took a similar approach to indemnifying insurers who cover homes at risk of flooding, through a scheme called Flood Re – though campaigners warn it took years to set up. Some leaseholders have seen their insurance premiums increase tenfold as a result of concerns about the fire safety of their homes. But rising premiums only account for a fraction of costs they face. Giles Grover, the spokesperson for the End Our Cladding Scandal campaign, faces a £20,000 bill at the City Gate complex in central Manchester and his insurance premium has almost tripled from £300 a year to £1,100. He gave Gove's initiative a cautious welcome. “It's the cost of the insurance and the interim fire safety measures that will make many bankrupt before remediation bills even land,” he said. “It is good he is looking at solutions that will protect us, but it is frustrating it has taken so long and the government has looked at this before but faced insurance industry opposition. We want a proper sit down with him about what the issues are. We don't expect immediate solutions, We just want him to listen to us.” The government already regularly publishes the names of companies that have reported they have unsafe aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding, but have not yet started remediation work. The latest list includes the hotel chain Travelodge but others under more opaque control. One, Adriatic Land 5 Ltd, which owns a building in Stevenage, is involved in a larger investment fund that delivers its income through ground rents. The Stevenage MP, Stephen McPartland , told parliament it is controlled by an entity in Guernsey. Gove has met Conservative rebels who have attacked the government's plans as inadequate – particularly for those in shorter blocks not covered by the £5bn building safety fund, which only covers combustible cladding. At least 30 Tory MPs including McPartland, Iain Duncan Smith and Peter Bottomley are expected to rebel against the building safety bill due to go through parliament this autumn, by proposing amendments to protect leaseholders from costs. The shadow housing secretary, Lucy Powell, welcomed the idea of an insurance scheme but said naming and shaming companies had already been tried, and largely failed. “We've been talking about naming and shaming for four years: it's done nothing. Unless you've got a big stick with that, it just doesn't work.” Labour has called for a building works agency that would identify what remediation is really necessary, commission the work using the £5bn repair fund, and then certify the outcome to give reassurance to mortgage lenders and insurers. “It's gone way beyond cladding,” she said. “You've got a crisis of confidence in the whole market in tall and multistorey blocks. You need a holistic approach.” The government has said it will set up a financing scheme to provide loans for leaseholders in smaller blocks to pay for remediations, limiting repayments to a maximum of £50 a month. But details have not yet been published about how it will operate. Meanwhile, leaseholders who live in shorter blocks with dangerous cladding are still facing huge costs and unsellable homes, as well as bearing costs for other fire safety measures. Many are unable to take action against developers who refuse to bear the costs, because of the prohibitive costs of legal action. The cross-party housing select committee has called for the proposed loans scheme to be scrapped in favour of a fund, jointly paid for by the government and industry, that would meet the full costs without leaseholders being forced to contribute. The government is also expected to withdraw the formal advice that has prompted lenders to demand an inspection form, called an EWS1, before granting mortgages on shorter buildings. Ministers announced in July that the forms should not be required for blocks lower than 18 metres, but there have been widespread reports of lenders continuing to insist on them. Before he lost his job in last month's reshuffle, the former housing secretary Robert Jenrick said he would withdraw the “consolidated advice notice” on building safety that lenders have been interpreting to mean they need an EWS1, “within the coming weeks”.",N UK news,,,

Tuesday is likely to bring supercell thunderstorms similar to those that rocked Sydney on Thursday night and caused a tornado in Armidale in the NSW tablelands. The Bureau is expecting close to 50mm of rain to be dumped over southeast Queensland in the first half of this week as an upper-level trough moves east across the state. Monday and Tuesday will bring thunderstorms to Brisbane with damaging winds, heavy rain and hail possible. Temperatures will reach the high 20s and the showers are forecast to continue until Saturday but should clear by Sunday. Sydney can expect fine weather on Monday with a high of 25C, similar to Sunday's temperatures. But by Tuesday afternoon, showers are likely to develop with the possibility of severe thunderstorms like the supercell that ripped through Sydney on Thursday evening. Damaging winds are also likely, leading to concerns another tornado could develop after regional NSW was battered by two in the last two weeks. On Thursday a tornado hit about 11pm in the northern tablelands. Armidale locals reported cars were flipped over by the wild twister, roofs were torn off houses, and powerlines exploded and were torn from the ground. Power cuts plunged 4,000 households in the area into darkness, with locals sharing images of golf ball-sized hail stones. One Armidale resident reported a close call with a gum tree that had been uprooted, smashing into a backyard shed wedged between her caravan and house. And two weeks earlier on September 30 a huge twister ripped through Meadow Flat, which is between Lithgow and Bathurst. Three people were injured and there were reports of damage to houses, powerlines and trees around the Clear Creek area, north north-east of Bathurst. Along with the damaging winds and horizontal rain, residents also reported large hailstones as the tornado swept through the community. Cladding was ripped from the roofs of houses after a tornado struck Armidale on Thursday night (pictured) Weatherzone forecaster Duncan Tippins said spring was the peak season for tornados. 'Australia doesn't have as many thunderstorms as places like the plains of the USA, but when we have thunderstorm outbreaks like we do in spring, we are more likely to see a tornado event than at other times of the year,' he said. Mr Tippens said supercell storms are needed to cause tornados - these are formed when a thunderstorm rotates as winds flow in different directions at different heights. He said there was not enough data available to comment on whether tornados were becoming more common in Australia. The rain is likely to set in on Wednesday for Sydney but should ease by Thursday though the cooler temperatures will remain into the weekend and some scattered showers are expected. Melbourne will also get some of the wet weather though not as heavy as further north with showers likely on each day this week with the exception of Wednesday which is looking mostly sunny.

Dangerous problems like inadequate fire safety, structural defects and dodgy waterproofing have appeared in two in five strata buildings across NSW, alarming research has revealed.

The cost of repairing these serious defects averaged nearly $332,000 per affected building, according to the Strata Community Association of NSW, the peak body for the strata industry.

Strata Community Association NSW president Chris Duggan said defect rectification was causing unnecessary strain and cost to owners in strata buildings.

The cost of repairing these serious defects averaged nearly $332,000 per affected building, according to the Strata Community Association of NSW, the peak body for the strata industry.
The most common defect was waterproofing issues, which was an issue in nearly two thirds of the buildings flagged as having problems.

Karl Stefanovic’s Sydney house up for grabs
Other common defects included problems with the fire safety systems (38 per cent), structure (27 per cent), key services (17 per cent) and non-compliant cladding (16 per cent).
These issues were rarely fixed quickly and most owners corporations took a year or longer to get the problems resolved, the survey of 1400 strata managers showed.
Few buildings reported being able to recover any of the costs of rectifying the defects.
Strata Community Association NSW president Chris Duggan said defect rectification was causing unnecessary strain and cost to owners in strata buildings. 
He urged residents to check that their strata manager was part of a professional standards scheme to ensure a strong duty of care. 
There are currently over 83,000 strata schemes in NSW providing housing for around 15 per cent of the state population. 
It comes as experts in the fire safety industry warned thousands of NSW residents were at risk of a “Grenfell Tower-style inferno” due to unsafe cladding products.
The Grenfell Tower in London made headlines in 2017 when a fire caused by a malfunctioning appliance quickly spread across the entire building due to highly flammable cladding. It was the worst residential fire in the UK since WWII.
It soon emerged the cladding problem was common in NSW buildings and efforts have been made to remediate buildings with safer materials.
But industry expert Dr Jonathan Barnett said the government-led remediating program used a simplistic approach when reviewing which cladding materials were allowed in buildings.
The program incorporated historically acceptable solutions, while ignoring newer technologies that delivered better results, Dr Barnett said.
Network Architectural co-founder Kim Regler said the state government needed to review which cladding products were permitted as part of the remediation efforts.
“NSW has big targets to remove and replace 225 of the worst-affected cladding buildings, so they should be considering all safe and compliant product options,” he said.

""We've had some pretty rough times,"" he said. His partner Sonia Gardner said it had taken a huge toll. ""It's been hard — emotionally, physically, mentally,"" she said. ""How do you explain that to four kids that their dad thinks that he failed them."" The couple embarked on their building project in 2016, after buying a waterfront block at Primrose Sands in Tasmania's south-east. They had planned a 564-square-metre home consisting of two storeys, five bedrooms and three bathrooms. It was designed to give the blended family of six room to move. ""We were excited,"" Mr Haley said. ""We were starting to build our dream for our four kids. ""They are going to get their own room, they were going to have their mates over for parties, they're going to have fun, you know."" Their budget for the home was around $630,000. ""Our build cost was just within our reach,"" Ms Gardner said. The build began late in 2016, but during the early stages of construction the couple began raising concerns with their builder about water coming into the house, walls not being level and windows being installed incorrectly to name a few. After repeatedly asking for the problems to be fixed the couple severed ties with the builder in early 2018. The house was only weeks away from completion. A defects report by a building surveyor lists around 47 issues with the build. One of the biggest problems is that the structural steel is not coated to specifications which means it is corroding. The report states ""removal of all external cladding, internal linings and timber framing will be necessary to provide required coatings"". ""Our experts said the most cost-effective way to fix this house would be to demolish it down to its slab,"" Mr Haley said. ""To demolish and to rebuild, we were quoted it was either just a little bit more than $2.4 million or just a little bit under. ""We can't afford that."" 'We could have bought another house' The couple sought help from the state government's building and consumer regulator. ""Their name is Consumer Building and Occupational Services (CBOS), we're the consumer, we have not had anything from them people to assist or doing anything whatsoever,"" Mr Haley said. ""Call a lawyer is basically what they said."" The couple contacted CBOS a number of times seeking help. They are critical that the regulator did not attempt to provide mediation between themselves and the builder. ""What is the point of having a building code and regulations if the people who are meant to enforce the regulations won't even look into the situation and resolve it,"" Ms Gardner said. In a statement to the ABC, a Department of Justice spokesman said: ""CBOS investigates and takes enforcement action within the regulatory framework where appropriate; however, in some cases disputes can only be resolved by civil action."" The spokesman said it would be inappropriate to discuss the specific detail of individual cases. The couple has spent $340,000 so far on legal fees as they prepare to mount a case in the Federal Court. ""We could have bought another house,"" Ms Gardner said. The couple have decided not to name their builder or the building company on legal advice. The builder has declined an opportunity to comment. As they wait for their day in court, the couple is still paying a mortgage on the shell of their waterfront home which they can't live in. But the impact of their building experience has cost them more than money. ""Our family has now split,"" Ms Gardner said. ""My eldest son, he has special needs, [and] he had to go live with his dad because we couldn't provide him the care that he needed."" ""We've got two boys now that are way into their young adulthood and adolescence. They still share a room. ""It's heartbreaking."" 'Wake up state government' Two months ago the ABC reported on the building defect experiences of Cygnet couple Adriane and Gillian Creamer The couple, who are near retirement age, engaged a builder two years ago to do a $400,000 renovation and extension to their home. But so far they have spent an extra $150,000 fixing defects and $50,000 on legal fees, with issues with the build such as walls not being completely vertical and floors not being level. They said the experience was the most traumatic of their life. In the time since the Creamers' story was told they have been contacted by over 40 people with similar experiences. Speaking recently, Mr Creamer said: ""This problem is huge."" ""If the building boom continues the way it is, it's only going to get worse and [there'll be] more of it,"" he said. ""So, wake up state government, wake up."" He said poor workmanship was taking an environmental toll. ""The amount of good material that's going to finish up on the planet wasted on our house alone is just wrong on so many levels,"" he said. Mr Creamer said he was planning to put pressure on the state government to improve building laws and better police them. ""We're hoping to band together enough people that have been wronged by the system, or been wronged by builders, to effect some change with the legislation in this state,"" he said. Government blocks a push for an inquiry Labor spokeswoman Jen Butler's recent bid for a parliamentary inquiry into the building industry failed when the government voted against it. ""We were so disappointed,"" she said. She said the current building boom had seen a growing number of consumers contacting her office over the last two years. ""We know of many consumers who are finding that there is severe structural damage to their properties, that they are unable to provide assistance through CBOS to have those works rectified,"" she said. Ms Butler said builders were worried too. ""We're speaking to quality builders, we're finding that they are pulling their hair out having to go to properties to try to rectify poor workmanship from other builders,"" she said. ""[There are] surveyors that are considering leaving the industry completely because there is such a lack of oversight."" Minister for Workplace Safety and Consumer Affairs Elise Archer said calls for a parliamentary inquiry were simply about politics and would do nothing to resolve building disputes. She said she was seeking advice from the Justice Department on opportunities to improve the building regulatory framework to better protect consumers, including considering whether the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal could handle disputes in the future to make them faster and cheaper to resolve.",Y,,,

      Flammable cladding has been removed for investigation from a Darlington apartment block as the NSW Government kicks off its billion-dollar Project Remediate program.

Project Remediate so far has more than 155 buildings registered for corrective work and is on track to remove all flammable cladding from eligible high-risk residential apartment buildings in the state by the end of 2023, Minister for Better Regulation Kevin Anderson says.

“Today is the start of a critical program that has been years in the making,” Mr Anderson said.  “We are now ready to fix a problem that has been burdening owners for a long time. This is an incredibly important moment for the families and residents living in apartments impacted by dangerous cladding.”

Project Remediate, launched in March, assures that when the cladding is overhauled the work will be accepted by insurers, and also provides no-interest loans and free expert management.

Managing Contractor Hansen Yuncken will investigate the materials gathered and ACOR will give expert engineering and design advice on the best remediation solution for each building, taking into consideration weatherproofing, wind resistance, durability, thermal insulation and aesthetics.

The money will help to create a £5billion fund to help cover the cost of repairs to dangerous cladding and fire safety defeats.

Mary-Anne Bowring, of the property management consultancy Ringley Group, said: 'A blanket tax on developers is fairer than leaving leaseholders to shoulder the burden but it is still a blunt instrument to use to fix the cladding crisis. '

The Chancellor said in the Budget that developers would be hit with the 4 per cent levy, which was at the higher end of the 3 to 4 per cent expected.

But those homeowners affected by the crisis said the money was not a new announcement and would fail to cover the true cost of the crisis. The Chancellor said in the Budget that developers would be hit with the 4 per cent levy, which was at the higher end of the 3 to 4 per cent expected. However, Rishi Sunak explained that only developers making profits of at least £25million would pay it. Speaking to MPs, the Chancellor said: 'We're confirming £5billion to remove unsafe cladding from the highest-risk buildings partly funded by the Residential Property Developer Tax, which I can confirm will be levied on developers with profits over £25million at a rate of 4 per cent.' Many homeowners have been left facing potentially ruinous bills after discovering dangerous cladding and fire defects on their properties. Such defects have been found on high-rise buildings across Britain following the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017. Lenders are now refusing to provide finance on some types of cladding, leaving some flat owners trapped in unsafe homes that they are unable to sell until the repair works are completed. The Building Safety Fund was set up to help those affected, applying to those in buildings above 18 metres high. Mary-Anne Bowring, of the property management consultancy Ringley Group, said: 'A blanket tax on developers is fairer than leaving leaseholders to shoulder the burden but it is still a blunt instrument to use to fix the cladding crisis. 'Fundamentally, accountability should fall squarely on those who overlooked the potential hazards of unsafe cladding in the first place.' Meanwhile, Lawrence Bowles, of estate agents Savills, said: 'At a time of rising materials and labour costs, and given likely falling transaction volumes next year, it is hard to know what this new levy will raise.' Leaseholders have reacted to the levy, saying it does not go far enough in helping those who are victims of a cladding scandal through no fault of their own. Twitter user Reece Lipman said: 'It does nothing to help. It's not new money, only going back into the promised £5billion.' And Steve Voller said the Chancellor is saving the Government money with the levy as its going towards the £5billion already announced. 'It does nothing to help leaseholders and doesn't plug the gap to the £15billion actually needed.' Meanwhile, another social media user with the name 'LeaseholdSlave' said: 'It is nowhere near enough to solve this crisis.' And Paul123 wrote: 'Feel totally let down by this Government. Its like asking a mugger in the street to say sorry and hand back a fraction of what they just stole from you.' A Twitter user who goes by the name 'Chewie' said the levy 'makes zero difference', adding: 'It's a slap on the wrist for developers and a slap in the face for leaseholders'. It follows the case of flat owner Emily Boswell who lives in a two-bedroom flat in Leeds Dock. The 26-year-old received an email from her management company about her service charges. It included an earth-shattering amount of £101,267.63, said to be for 'external wall remediation 2021-22'. Miss Boswell explained: 'We've been told we don't have to pay this money right this second - as if we're in a position to pay it anyway - because our Building Safety Fund application is still underway. 'But it had to be included in our service charge bill for the coming year in case we do not get any funding. We already know that two of the materials - brickwork and tiling with no fire breaks beneath - and our balconies are not eligible for funding.'",Y,,,

It sets a new deadline of December, 2026 for legal action to commence, building on the original 10-year liability period that came into effect last December. In February, the Victorian government announced a new amendment to the state's building code which banned the use of aluminium composite panels with a core of less than 93 per cent inert mineral filler and expanded polystyrene products used in an external insulation of multi-storey buildings. The state government committed $7 million towards insurance to force builders to take on rectification work on hundreds of residential buildings covered with combustible cladding across the Victoria. The policy will cover the work of builders and practitioners on rectification jobs overseen by agency Cladding Safety Victoria as securing professional indemnity insurance for cladding-related work on the open market is all but impossible. It will now go after developers on behalf of owners, with penalties available of $80,000 for individuals and up to $400,000 for businesses. ▲ Cladding Safety Victoria said it is working with a select group of reputable builders to rectify their projects at no-profit. Cladding Safety Victoria currently has cladding removal and replacement projects complete or under way on 200 residential apartment buildings across the state with another 53 having signed funding agreements and due to commence work soon. Work has been completed on 60 public buildings, including 40 school buildings, eight Victoria Police stations, seven public housing complexes and stadia. However, the list of buildings needing cladding rectification is now growing by an estimated 10 to 15 buildings each month. More than 700 buildings have been classified as in the highest risk categories, well above the government's original estimate of 500 when it announced a $600-million rectification package in the Victorian budget of 2019-20. The original funding and program— scheduled to run for five years —was initially projected to support rectifying cladding on the government's stated 500 figure. Cladding Safety Victoria chief executive Dan O'Brien said soon after his appointment in August, 2019 that he expected the total to rise on the government's early estimates. More than 3200 properties have been inspected during the past three years as part of Victoria's statewide cladding audit. NSW government considers extending assistance Work began this week to remove high-risk cladding from a Darlington apartment building, the first of more than 150 in NSW registered for the government's Project Remediate program. The work on the building comes seven years after a fire in Melbourne's Lacrosse tower , which was fuelled by combustible cladding. The NSW government said the program would provide no-interest loans, free expert program management and the assurance that when remediation work is completed, the work will be accepted by insurers. NSW building commissioner David Chandler said the program had been set up with a consistent approach which assured owners their interests are considered the highest priority. “Cladding removal and building remediation is not just about taking off a piece of cladding and replacing it with another,” Chandler said. “It's an opportunity to get a thorough up-front investigation and assessment of the building to determine what is needed to do the job properly.” More than 100 apartment and office buildings in the City of Sydney have been classified as at high risk of fire because of flammable cladding. The state government set aside $139 million in its November budget towards what it said would be a three-year rectification process for the 225 buildings, but has not yet said how the process will be rolled out.",Y,,,

The cost of repairing these serious defects averaged nearly $332,000 per affected building, according to the Strata Community Association of NSW, the peak body for the strata industry.

Strata Community Association NSW president Chris Duggan said defect rectification was causing unnecessary strain and cost to owners in strata buildings.

The most common defect was waterproofing issues, which was an issue in nearly two thirds of the buildings flagged as having problems. MORE: NRL stars' post season selling spree Karl Stefanovic's Sydney house up for grabs Other common defects included problems with the fire safety systems (38 per cent), structure (27 per cent), key services (17 per cent) and non-compliant cladding (16 per cent). These issues were rarely fixed quickly and most owners corporations took a year or longer to get the problems resolved, the survey of 1400 strata managers showed. Few buildings reported being able to recover any of the costs of rectifying the defects. Strata Community Association NSW president Chris Duggan said defect rectification was causing unnecessary strain and cost to owners in strata buildings. He urged residents to check that their strata manager was part of a professional standards scheme to ensure a strong duty of care. There are currently over 83,000 strata schemes in NSW providing housing for around 15 per cent of the state population. It comes as experts in the fire safety industry warned thousands of NSW residents were at risk of a “Grenfell Tower-style inferno” due to unsafe cladding products. The Grenfell Tower in London made headlines in 2017 when a fire caused by a malfunctioning appliance quickly spread across the entire building due to highly flammable cladding. It was the worst residential fire in the UK since WWII. It soon emerged the cladding problem was common in NSW buildings and efforts have been made to remediate buildings with safer materials. But industry expert Dr Jonathan Barnett said the government-led remediating program used a simplistic approach when reviewing which cladding materials were allowed in buildings. The program incorporated historically acceptable solutions, while ignoring newer technologies that delivered better results, Dr Barnett said. Network Architectural co-founder Kim Regler said the state government needed to review which cladding products were permitted as part of the remediation efforts. “NSW has big targets to remove and replace 225 of the worst-affected cladding buildings, so they should be considering all safe and compliant product options,” he said.

“At this rate, Victoria will have removed cladding from half of its buildings before NSW even begins,” she says.NSW Labor says the Victorian government has helped 40 apartment buildings remove flammable cladding.The NSW government’s two-year project to remove the cladding, originally scheduled to commence this year, has been put on hold until next year.NSW Building Commissioner David Chandler, whose office is overseeing Project Remediate, says the project was expected to begin as soon as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted.

NSW Building Commissioner David Chandler said Project Remediate — the three-year program that provides building owners with low interest loans to fix their properties — was delayed due to Covid-19 restrictions. Mr Chandler said he was confident the project would be finished by its three-year deadline and that Victorian authorities had started their own project “without the full exposure (of risk) being clear”. “Both our approaches are different,” he said. “They committed to the project with less line-of-sight than we have. “There is a significant cost blowout in Victoria. “That is an unacceptable outcome in NSW.” Lisa Wilkinson has revealed how she was sexually assaulted by her friend's father when in high school.

Shadow Minister for Better Regulation Courtney Houssos said the government's process for removing flammable cladding was wrapped in red tape. “Project Remediate punishes apartment owners who did the right thing and acted quickly to address the fire risk.

But you still need to be alert to potential legal curveballs during the purchasing process to ensure your transaction happens as smoothly as possible. Here are some legal tips that will help you navigate buying a house and land. Should I buy off the plan? 1. Land assessment Before you even consider signing up to buy a house and land package, it's important to conduct due diligence. “Buyers need to carry out their own inquiries to carefully consider the land size, drainage and position before committing to any land purchase,” said Louise Hethorn, principal solicitor at Your Property Lawyers. “Buyers should conduct their due diligence, including physically attending the land site, contacting council to understand the development application process and any restrictions imposed on development of the land.” Ms Hethorn said consideration should also be given to any restrictions on the percentage of the land that can be occupied by a building as this could alter any ideas you might have about the dream home you want to construct. In some areas there was a maximum of 50% of the land allowed to be occupied by a house, she said. “This will impact on the design and style of your home or whether you proceed with the purchase of land,” she said. “It is important to have a solicitor or conveyancer review the contract of sale including any additional clauses, title search, plans, dealings, sewer diagrams and council planning certificate to ensure you understand the vendor's contract.” A formal valuation is an important part of the house and land buying process. “When borrowing funds for a house and land package your bank will carry out a valuation of the land prior to exchange of contracts or during the five business day cooling off period,” Ms Hethorn said. “This will ensure if the purchase price is higher than the value of the land, you may exercise the right to rescind the contract and forfeit only 0.25% of the purchase price during the cooling off period. “Ideally, your broker or banker will provide the valuation prior to exchange of contracts to avoid any potential loss if the value does not equal the purchase price.” 2. Contracts When buying house and land, there will be two contracts. One for the sale of the land, and another for the construction. “The contracts are separate and not dependent on each other, therefore any delay caused in the settlement of the land may have an impact on the building contract entered into for the construction,” Ms Hethorn said. The sales process differs state-to-state, so you should do your research about what needs to be included in your contracts. Off-the-plan contracts for the sale of land It's important to remember that buying land that is being subdivided off-the-plan is conditional upon the registration of the plan. Ms Hethorn said if the construction start date is delayed because of the subdivision process, penalties may apply daily under the building contract. Delays in the commencement of construction may also result in increased material costs. “When buying land off-the-plan you may be given a guide on the likely time the subdivision of land will be complete. This is a guide only as the process of subdivision is subject to many council requirements being met to allow registration of the land on a separate title,” she said. The registration process is dependent upon the developer passing through all requirements of various authorities to provide water, electricity, drainage and sewage to the land. “The council may also require the developer to set up a Neighbourhood Plan or Community Title for owners in the community to pay levies towards expenses such as security, gardening or water where it is not individually metered to each property,” Ms Hethorn said. “It is important that your representative checks whether the council is responsible for the upkeep of roads within the community or whether owners are required to contribute to cover road expenses. “Before or during a cooling off period or during a building/pest condition period, an inspection of owners corporation records for Neighbourhood Plan or Community Plan properties can be ordered to check any outstanding expenses, special levies due or likely to be raised in the near future.” Settlement depends on the registration of the land. Purchasers have 21 days from the date of notice of registration to complete settlement. Standard land contracts Ms Hethorn said standard land contracts were more straight-forward. “Contracts for the sale of registered land can be completed in standard time periods according to the terms of the contract and therefore removes the risk of entering into a building contract prematurely when buying land off the plan,” she said. Building contracts First and foremost, it is important to engage a reputable builder. Most states have online licence searches available so you can check the contractor licence details. In NSW, the home building contract must include a statement that the contract includes a five business day cooling-off period (if the value is over $20,000) and an insurance certificate under the Home Building Compensation (HBC) Scheme. You should contact the insurer to check the certificate is valid. Purchasers wanting to buy land and enter a contract to erect a building on their land are subject to the clauses within the building contract. Your solicitor or conveyancer can assist by reviewing the building contract and help you to understand your rights and obligations. Caveat Emptor … or buyer beware The buyer should also be aware of certain clauses in the contract. For example, there is often a clause in the building contract that any excess building materials that are onsite after ‘cutting the block' are the buyer's responsibility. “In the event 200 tonnes excess materials are left on the land after ‘cutting the block' and builders quoting $1,000.00 per load to remove the material this would add an additional cost of approximately $16,000.00 to the project,” Ms Hethorn warned. “You may be able to negotiate with the builders prior to signing the building contract, to agree to remove the excess materials at a reduced fee to ensure no surprise expenses or potential delays in the project.” She said the building contract may also require the owner to be responsible for payment of any retaining wall required as part of the building project. “It is important that owners understand their responsibilities under the contract and schedule completion of parts of the project at suitable times, to avoid delays in the construction. “The contract needs to include a description of the proposed works, plans and specifications of the build. The deposit amount must not exceed 10% of the contract price.” “Post-contract variations attract a builder's margin increase. “The building contract will include the minimum features and it is important to plan ahead to ensure common necessities such as adequate power points and any other desired features are included, to avoid post contract variations. “Your solicitor or conveyancer will check the ‘builder's margin' in the contract, the contract price and whether the price is subject to change and the payment schedule. The standard builder's margin is 20%.” 3. Conveyancing and expert advice Along with the sales process, conveyancing in Australia varies in different states and territories. Some states, like Western Australia, do not have a cooling-off period. You should check the regulations in the state where you intend to make your house and land package purchase before you sign on the dotted line. Ms Hethorn said a trusted solicitor or conveyancer should review the building contract to ensure it all the necessary details, including: The correct contractor licence details.

A defects report by a building surveyor lists around 47 issues with the build. One of the biggest problems is that the structural steel is not coated to specifications which means it is corroding. The couple were left paying a mortgage on an unfinished house after cutting ties with the builder. ABC News: Luke Bowden The report states ""removal of all external cladding, internal linings and timber framing will be necessary to provide required coatings"". ""Our experts said the most cost-effective way to fix this house would be to demolish it down to its slab,"" Mr Haley said. ""To demolish and to rebuild, we were quoted it was either just a little bit more than $2.4 million or just a little bit under. ""We can't afford that."" The building process has been a nightmare for Kev Haley and Sonia Gardner. ABC News: Luke Bowden 'We could have bought another house' The couple sought help from the state government's building and consumer regulator. ""Their name is Consumer Building and Occupational Services (CBOS), we're the consumer, we have not had anything from them people to assist or doing anything whatsoever,"" Mr Haley said. ""Call a lawyer is basically what they said."" The couple contacted CBOS a number of times seeking help. They are critical that the regulator did not attempt to provide mediation between themselves and the builder. ""What is the point of having a building code and regulations if the people who are meant to enforce the regulations won't even look into the situation and resolve it,"" Ms Gardner said. In a statement to the ABC, a Department of Justice spokesman said: ""CBOS investigates and takes enforcement action within the regulatory framework where appropriate; however, in some cases disputes can only be resolved by civil action."" The spokesman said it would be inappropriate to discuss the specific detail of individual cases. The couple has spent $340,000 so far on legal fees as they prepare to mount a case in the Federal Court. ""We could have bought another house,"" Ms Gardner said. The couple sought help from the state government's building and consumer regulator. ABC News: Luke Bowden The couple have decided not to name their builder or the building company on legal advice. The builder has declined an opportunity to comment.

But the impact of their building experience has cost them more than money. ""Our family has now split,"" Ms Gardner said.

""We've got two boys now that are way into their young adulthood and adolescence. They still share a room. ""It's heartbreaking."" 'Wake up state government' Two months ago the ABC reported on the building defect experiences of Cygnet couple Adriane and Gillian Creamer The couple, who are near retirement age, engaged a builder two years ago to do a $400,000 renovation and extension to their home. There were 30 defects with Adriane and Gillian Creamer's renovation ABC News: Maren Preuss But so far they have spent an extra $150,000 fixing defects and $50,000 on legal fees, with issues with the build such as walls not being completely vertical and floors not being level. They said the experience was the most traumatic of their life. In the time since the Creamers' story was told they have been contacted by over 40 people with similar experiences. Speaking recently, Mr Creamer said: ""This problem is huge."" ""If the building boom continues the way it is, it's only going to get worse and [there'll be] more of it,"" he said. ""So, wake up state government, wake up."" He said poor workmanship was taking an environmental toll. ""The amount of good material that's going to finish up on the planet wasted on our house alone is just wrong on so many levels,"" he said. Mr Creamer said he was planning to put pressure on the state government to improve building laws and better police them. ""We're hoping to band together enough people that have been wronged by the system, or been wronged by builders, to effect some change with the legislation in this state,"" he said. Government blocks a push for an inquiry Labor spokeswoman Jen Butler's recent bid for a parliamentary inquiry into the building industry failed when the government voted against it. ""We were so disappointed,"" she said. She said the current building boom had seen a growing number of consumers contacting her office over the last two years. ""We know of many consumers who are finding that there is severe structural damage to their properties, that they are unable to provide assistance through CBOS to have those works rectified,"" she said. Kev Haley and Sonia Gardner have spent $340,000 on legal fees so far. ABC News: Luke Bowden Ms Butler said builders were worried too. ""We're speaking to quality builders, we're finding that they are pulling their hair out having to go to properties to try to rectify poor workmanship from other builders,"" she said. ""[There are] surveyors that are considering leaving the industry completely because there is such a lack of oversight."" Minister for Workplace Safety and Consumer Affairs Elise Archer said calls for a parliamentary inquiry were simply about politics and would do nothing to resolve building disputes. She said she was seeking advice from the Justice Department on opportunities to improve the building regulatory framework to better protect consumers, including considering whether the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal could handle disputes in the future to make them faster and cheaper to resolve.",Y but duplicate with previous,,,

Border closures and FOMO have led to buyers in the country’s largest capitals jumping in to purchase properties sight unseen without undergoing pest and building inspections.

According to a recent survey by ME Bank, around one-third of buyers failed to arrange a pest and building inspection before buying their property.

According to buyer’s agent Lloyd Edge of Aus Property professionals, interstate buyers and those in lockdown who have been unable to inspect properties in person have fallen victim to the hype generated by selling agents during a period of intense demand.

It’s creating a lot of FOMO.”He said the fear of missing out was prevalent due to the ongoing media coverage of real estate topping new sales records in multiple locations across the country. This has meant buyers in the Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane markets who have already missed out on properties due to the unprecedented level of demand throughout the pandemic have started jumping in without first undergoing due diligence.“Sometimes they’ll buy having seen a couple of photos or a video,” he said.Edge echoed the concerns of Daniel Ball, a Melbourne property buyer who had uncovered several instances of properties listed with inaccurate descriptions. As reported in the Financial Review, Ball had walked away from several buying opportunities after discovering serious issues at a number of properties. As a pool cleaner, he was able to inspect properties in person at a time when most other buyers were bound by lockdown restrictions.“We have been looking for about five months and house prices over that time in Victoria have jumped up $150,000,” he told the Financial Review. “We quickly realised that professional photos online were misleading, and [we] never thought we’d accept bidding for homes that we had not seen. However, as our budget is limited, we realised that we had to follow the rest of the market and bid or miss out entirely.”According to the Fin Review, Ball had identified structural flaws, evidence of termite infestations, rotting floors and broken-down pools when viewing properties in person.According to a recent survey by ME Bank, around one-third of buyers failed to arrange a pest and building inspection before buying their property. This has led to some costly mistakes. Out of the top post-purchase property problems identified by owners, construction quality was number one at 32% while paintwork (28%), gardens and fences (23%), fittings and chattels (21%) and neighbours (17%) followed closely behind.ME Bank general manager John Powell told MPA that while around one-third of buyers didn’t arrange a pest and building report before buying, the benefits of doing so were clear.“It pays to arrange one,” he said. “Buying a property is potentially the biggest purchase your client will make, and they will be extremely grateful for reminding them of the importance of getting a proper inspection. Buyers can also use inspection information as a tool to negotiate and get a better understanding of how much things will cost to fix or replace – and budget into their overall cost of buying.”Edge agreed that organising a pest and building report before buying was crucial.“It’s imperative to get a building and pest inspection done,” he said. “Even if you look at a property through a visual inspection on FaceTime, you can’t tell if it has got structural damage or termites. If that means missing out on a couple of properties because they do sell, you need to forego that. The few hundreds of dollars it costs to get a building and pest done, that could save you thousands or hundreds of thousands if you end up buying the wrong property.”According to Powell, the results of ME Bank’s study revealed some clear insights around the impact of market pressures on homebuyers during periods of lockdown.“Around 61% of Australian homebuyers discovered issues with their property after moving in,” he said. “About 18% of this group said they missed picking up these issues because they were ‘impatient and concerned by rising prices’ – rising to 37% among those who purchased since the COVID-19 pandemic.”He said brokers could play an important role in helping their clients make the right choices when it came to buying their home.",Y but it's info,,,

The second surveyor's report listed a number of problems.
""He [the builder] got about 30 things wrong with the build, 30 defects, 12 of which were so serious we couldn't live in the house or sell the house until they were satisfactorily repaired,"" Mr Creamer said.

In a statement, a spokesman said during construction, the building surveyor can issue direction notices to require rectification of defects. 
""If a builder fails to comply, the permit authority of the relevant council has powers to enforce compliance,"" the spokesman said.
If defects are discovered after practical completion, CBOS said it had a range of dispute resolution processes, including adjudication.
""And an adjudication outcome made by a panel, has the effect of an order of the Magistrates Court,"" the spokesman said.
The Creamers, who were desperate to move into their home, were worried this process could drag on for many months, if not years, and did not trust their builder to properly repair the work.

The Minister for Consumer Affairs, Elise Archer, has already rejected the idea of a parliamentary inquiry, even before the terms of reference have been tabled in Parliament.

 Mr Creamer has begun warning others about his situation, in the hope it won't happen to anyone else. (ABC News: Maren Preuss
)She said many of their issues related to legislation that had since been strengthened.
""While many of the issues raised relate to circumstances before our amendments, I have asked my department to look at any potential improvements that could be made to further strengthen the framework moving forward,"" Ms Archer said.
""Therefore, there is no need for a parliamentary inquiry,"" she said.
 Ms Archer says work is underway to make the disputes process less convoluted. (ABC News: Luke Bowden

Other common defects included problems with the fire safety systems (38 per cent), structure (27 per cent), key services (17 per cent) and non-compliant cladding (16 per cent).

These issues were rarely fixed quickly and most owners corporations took a year or longer to get the problems resolved, the survey of 1400 strata managers showed.

Few buildings reported being able to recover any of the costs of rectifying the defects.

Strata Community Association NSW president Chris Duggan said defect rectification was causing unnecessary strain and cost to owners in strata buildings. 

He urged residents to check that their strata manager was part of a professional standards scheme to ensure a strong duty of care. 

There are currently over 83,000 strata schemes in NSW providing housing for around 15 per cent of the state population.

The Grenfell Tower in London made headlines in 2017 when a fire caused by a malfunctioning appliance quickly spread across the entire building due to highly flammable cladding. It was the worst residential fire in the UK since WWII.

It soon emerged the cladding problem was common in NSW buildings and efforts have been made to remediate buildings with safer materials.

But industry expert Dr Jonathan Barnett said the government-led remediating program used a simplistic approach when reviewing which cladding materials were allowed in buildings.

The program incorporated historically acceptable solutions, while ignoring newer technologies that delivered better results, Dr Barnett said.

Network Architectural co-founder Kim Regler said the state government needed to review which cladding products were permitted as part of the remediation efforts.

“NSW has big targets to remove and replace 225 of the worst-affected cladding buildings, so they should be considering all safe and compliant product options,” he said.",Y duplicate,,,
